tity, including, without limitation, proceeds received or to be
received on an accrual basis by any entity related to an NBA
Team in accordance with subsection (a)(4)(i) below, that sold,

other than the additional amounts paid by lUXury suite holders
to the Team for tickets, if any, this amount shall be the only
amount included in BRI for the sale, lease or licensing of luxury
suites and that, to the extent that the sale, lease or licensing of
the lUXury suite grants rights to the luxury suite for a period of
more than one year, for purposes of calculating the amount in-
cludable in BRI for any NBA Season, the proceeds shall be
determined on the basis of the annual fee or charge provided
for in any such transaction and, if payments are made in addi-
tion to or in the absence of such an annual fee or charge, the
value of such payments shall be amortized over the period of
the sale, lease or license, unless such period exceeds twenty
years, in which event an amortization period of twenty years
shall be used;
              (viii) except as provided in subsection (a)(2) below,

directly attributable to the generation of such proceeds, as long as
those expenses are consistent with the types and categories of ex-
penses incurred by Properties reflected in the audited financial
reports for Properties for the year ended July 31, 1994 (or, in the
case of new sources of revenues, as long as the expenses are rea-
sonable and customary, in the opinion of the Accountants), in-
cluding proceeds derived from the following categories (defined
in the same manner as was used in those audited financial reports):
(A) international television; (B) sponsorships; (C) NBA-related
revenues from NBA Entertainment; (D) the All-Star Game and
McDonald's Championship; (E) other NBA special events; and
(F) all other sources of revenue received by Properties other than

                                                                       'i
   amortized over the period of the license (including, without
   limitation, such proceeds received or to be received on an
   accrual basis ,by any entity related to an NBA Team, in ac-
   cordance with subsection (a)( 4 )(i) below), unless such pe-
   riod exceeds twenty years, in which event an amortization
   period of twenty years shall be used,
            (2) It is understood that the following is a non-exclu-
   sive list of examples of revenues received by the NBA, Proper-
   ties, NBA Teams and each of their related entities that are not
   derived from, and do not relate to or arise out of, the perfor-
   mance of Players in NBA basketball games or in NBA-related
   activities or are otherwise expressly excluded from the defini-
   tion of BRI: proceeds from the assignment, sale or trade of
   Player Contracts, proceeds from the sale of any existing NBA
   franchise (or any interest therein) or the grant of NBA expan-
   sion franchises, dues or capital contributions received by the
   NBA, fines, revenue sharing (by reason of revenue transfers or
   otherwise) among Teams, interest income, insurance recoveries,
   sales of interest in real estate and other property, and proceeds
   received by Properties (i) pursuant to the Group License Agree-
   ment; (ii) pursuant to the Events Agreement; and (iii) relating
   to the following categories (defined in the same manner as
   was used in the audited financial reports for Properties for the
   year ended July 31, 1994): (A) licensing; and/or (B) the rep-
   resentation by Properties of third parties. For purposes of
   the foregoing sentence, "third parties" refers to persons or en-
   tities that are not owned or controlled by persons or entities
   that own or control an NBA team or, if such third party is "an
   entity related to an NBA team" (as defined below), NBA Prop-
   erties' representation does not relate either to such entity's NBA
   ownership or NBA players.
            (3) Subject to Article VII, Section 9 (Players Associa-
   tion Audit Rights), with respect to expenses incurred in con-
   nection with all proceeds coming within subsections (a)(l)(v)
   and (viii) above, all reported expenses shall be conclusively45
presumed to be reasonable and customary (other than expenses
related to sources of revenues that were not reflected in the
audited financial report for Properties for the year ended
July 31, 1994), and such expenses shall not be the subject of
the accounting procedures set forth in Article VII, Section 8 of
this Agreement. Such expenses shall be disallowed, however,
to the extent that they exceed the ratio of League-wide reported
expenses to League-wide reported revenues (the "Expense Ra-
tio") for that category of revenues set forth in Exhibit C hereto.
         (4) It is acknowledged by the parties hereto that for
purposes of determining BRI:
             (i) Some NBA Teams have engaged or may engage
in transactions with third parties that are owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by the persons or entities owning or con-
trolling the NBA Team (such third parties are referred to in this
Agreement as "an entity related to an NBA Team"). As pro-
vided in subsections (a)(l)(i)-(vii) and (ix) above, the relevant
proceeds received or to be received on an accrual basis by any
entity related to an NBA Team that come within those para-
graphs and that relate to such entity's related NBA Team shall
be included in BRI. To the extent, however, that such net pro-
ceeds cannot reasonably be determined for transactions entered
into with an entity related to an NBA Team after the date of
this Agreement, the Accountants retained pursuant to the pro-
visions of Article VII, Section 8 of this Agreement shall deter-
mine a reasonable value which shall be included in BRI for the
first NBA Season to which the transaction pertains. For each
Season thereafter in which the transaction remains in effect,
the same amount - or an equivalent annualized amount if the
transaction pertained to less than a full Season - will be in-
cluded in BRI increased (or decreased, as the case may be) by
the amount the League-wide per-Team average for such net
proceeds increased (or decreased) over the previous Season.
             (ii) With respect to transactions with an entity re-
lated to an NBA Team pertaining to proceeds that come withinsubsections (a)(1)(ii), (a)(1)(v) and (a)(l)(vi) above that are in
   effect as of June 21, 1995, the parties agree that the projected
   amounts to be earned by the entity related to the NBA Team for
   the 1995-96 NBA Season as reflected in Exhibit D hereto are
   reasonable and that the methodology employed to determine
   these amounts, including all allocations of revenues and ex-
   penses, so long as the transaction between the NBA Team and
   the related third party remains unchanged, shall be conclusively
   presumed to be reasonable. This methodology will be used to
   determine the applicable amounts for NBA Seasons subsequent
   to the 1995-96 NBA Season.                                         '   1
                (iii) With respect to the transactions listed below
   in this subsection (a)(4)(iii) between an NBA Team and an en-
   tity related to the Team, the parties agree that, because the pro-
   ceeds attributable to these transactions cannot be accurately
   ascertained, the following procedures shall be used for each
   NBA Season in which these transactions remain in effect:
                     (A) New York Knicks transaction with MSG            J
   Network regarding the sale of local media rights (the "MSG
   Network Transaction"): BRI for the Knicks for the 1995-96
   NBA Season shall include an amount equal to the net proceeds
   included in BRI attributable to the Los Angeles Lakers' sale,
   license or other conveyance of all local media rights (includ-
   ing, but not limited to, broadcast and cable television and ra-
   dio). In each subsequent Season covered by this Agreement,
   this amount shall be increased (or decreased, as the case may
   be), for each category of local media rights, by the average of
   the League-wide average percentage increase (or decrease) for         _l
   each such category.
                     (B) New York Knicks transactions with related
   parties involving signage: BRI for the Knicks for the 1995-96
   NBA Season shall include \$3,000,000 for signage. In each sub-
   sequent Season covered by this Agreement, this amount shall
   be increased (or decreased, as the case may be) by the League-
                                                                       I  '-,47
wide average percentage increase (or decrease) in signage as
determined in such subsections (a)(1)(v) 'and (a)(1)(vi),
         (5) Pursuant to the NBA's national broadcast and net-
work cable television agreements with NBC and TBS in effect
as of the execution date of this Agreement, NBA Teams might
receive revenue sharing proceeds in the 1997-98 NBA Season
that are attributable, at least in part, to NBA game telecasts in
that and prior NBA Seasons (referred to hereinafter as "Rev-
enue Sharing Proceeds"), An amount up to \$36 million of Rev-
enue Sharing Proceeds shall be included in BRI for the 1997-
98 NBASeason, In addition, Revenue Sharing Proceeds in ex-
cess of \$36 million (the "Excess Revenue Sharing Proceeds"),
if any, shall be included in BRI for the 1997-98 NBA Season to
the extent of (i) 50\% of the Excess Revenue Sharing Proceeds,
plus (ii) the amount, if any, determined by the following calcu-
lation:
     Step 1:      add 50\% of the Excess Revenue Sharing
                  Proceeds (the "1996-97 Rollback
                  Amount") to 1996-97 BRI (the "1996-97
                  Adjusted BRI");
     Step 2:      multiply 1996-97 Adjusted BRI by ,SOB;
     Step 3:      subtract from the result in Step 2 Total
                  Salaries and Benefits for the 1996-97
                  Season;
     Step 4:      if the result in Step 3 is a positive
                  amount, divide such amount by .5013, then
                  include the result in 1997-98 BRI, up to the
                  amount of the 1996-97 Rollback Amount.
     With respect to revenue sharing proceeds or other contin-
gent payments attributable to NBASeasons during the term of
this Agreemynt, if any, that are provided for in national
broadcast or network cable television agreements that suc-
ceed the present NBAjNBC and NBA/TBS agreements (the1

                                                                       1-
   "Successor Agreements"), such proceeds or contingent pay-
   ments, if any, shall be included in BRI in a manner to be deter-
                                                                               -'1
   mined by agreement of the parties, or if the parties do not reach   I-~
   an agreement, in a manner to be determined by the Accoun-
   tants.

   mined in accordance with the following:
                                                                           __ --.1

   are or may be received by the NBA pursuant to such contracts
   (including the Revenue Sharing Proceeds), which proceeds shall
                                                                       '__ J

    Step 1:      Subtract \$36 million from the Revenue Shar-
                 ing Estimate (as defined below);
    Step 2:      Multiply the result in Step 1 by 0.5 (the
                 "Adjusted Rollback Amount");
    Step 3:      Add the result in Step 2 to 1996-97 BRI;
    Step 4:      Multiply the result in Step 3 by .5013;
    Step 5:      Subtract from the result in Step 4 Total Salaries
                 and Benefits for the 1996-97 Season;
    Step 6:      If the result in Step 5 is a positive amount, di-
                 vide such amount by .5013, then add the result,
                 up to the amount of the Adjusted Rollback
                 Amount, to the result in Step 2;
    Step 7:      Subtract from the result in Step 6 \$14 million
                 (the "Adjusted Revenue Sharing Estimate");
    Step 8:      The Adjusted Revenue Sharing Estimate, if any,
                 shall be included in Projected BRI for the 1998-
                 99 through 2000- 2001 Seasons as follows:
                 (x) Any amount of the Adjusted Revenue Shar-
                 ing Estimate, up to an amount that would result
                 in a Salary Cap increase of \$250,000, shall be
                 included in Projected BRI for the 1998-99 Sea-
                 son;(y) Any amount of the Adjusted Revenue Shar-
                    ing Estimate that remains after application of

    will equal the greater of:
                 (i) 1996-97:    \$24.3  million
                      1997-98:   \$25.0  million
                      1998-99:   \$26.0  million
                      1999-00:   \$27.0  million
                      2000-01:   \$28.0  million
    (the "Guaranteed Minimum Salary Caps"); or
                 (ii) 48.04\% of Projected BRI, less Projected Ben-
    efits (as defined in Article IV, Section 2(a», plus or minus any
    Salary Cap adjustments (pursuantto subsection (d) below), di-
   vided by (A) 27 with respect to the 1996-1997 Season, and (B)29 with respect to each remaining Season of the Agreement
   (the "Calculated Salary Cap").
            (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) above, in the event
   that Projected BRI for the 1996-97 Season, plus Projected Lo-
   cal Expansion Team BRI for the 1996-97 Season, less Projected
   Benefits (including for the Expansion Teams), plus or minus
   any Salary Cap adjustments (pursuant to subsection (d) below)
   divided by 29 (the "Expansion Adjusted 1996-97 Salary Cap"),
   exceeds the Calculated Salary Cap for 1996-97, the Expansion
   Adjusted 1996-97 Salary Cap will apply for purposes of sub-
   section (a)(1)(ii) above.
            (3) The Salary Cap for the 1995-96 Season is \$23.0 million.
   In the event that, based upon the calculation of BRI for the 1995-96
   Season, the Calculated Salary Cap for the 1995-96 Season would
   have exceeded \$23.0 million, the difference will be added to the
   Salary Cap for the 1996-97 Season. For purposes of the fore-
   going calculation only, the Calculated Salary Cap for the 1995-
   96 Season will equal 48.04\% of actual 1995-96 BRI, less Ben-
   efits, divided by 27.
            (4) Commencing on the first day of each Salary Cap
   Year, the Salary Cap shall be the greater of (i) the Guaranteed
   Minimum Salary Cap for such Salary Cap Year, or (ii) the Sal-
   ary Cap for the prior Salary Cap Year (the "July 1 Salary Cap").
   The July 1 Salary Cap will remain in effect until August 15, at
   which time the Salary Cap will be the amount calculated pur-
   suant to subsections (a)(1)-(3) above.
            (5) Notwithstanding subsection (4) above, in the event
   that the Audit Report for a Salary Cap Year, beginning with the
   1996-97 Salary Cap Year, has not been completed as of the fol-
   lowing August 15, then, beginning on August 16 and continu-
   ing until the Audit Report is completed, the Salary Cap shall be
   the greater of (i) the July 1 Salary Cap or (ii) an amount calcu-
   lated pursuant to subsections (a)(1)- (3) above, except that In-
   terim Projected BRI shall be utilized instead of Projected BRI.The Salary Cap calculated pursuant to this subsection (5) (the
    "Interim Salary Cap") will remain in effect until the Audit Re-
    port is completed, at which time the Salary Cap will be the
    amount calculated pursuant to subsections (a)(I)-(3) above.
        (b) Minimum Team Salary.
             (1) For each Season during the term of this Agreement,
    there shall be a Minimum Team Salary equal to 75\% of the
    Salary Cap for such Season.
             (2) In the event that, by the conclusion of the Salary
    Cap Year for a Season, a Team has failed to make aggregate
    Salary payments and/or incur aggregate Salary obligations equal
    to or greater than the applicable Minimum Team Salary for that
    Season, the NBA shall cause such Team to make such payments
    (to be disbursed to the players on such Team pro rata or in ac-
    cordance with such other formula as may be reasonably deter-
    mined by the Players Association).
             (3) Nothing contained herein shall preclude a Team
    from having a Team Salary in excess of the Minimum Team
    Salary, provided that the Team's Team Salary does not exceed
    the Salary Cap plus any additional amounts authorized pursu-
    ant to the Exceptions set forth in this Article VII.
        (c) Expansion Team Salary Caps and Minimum Team
Salaries. The Expansion Teams shall have the same Salary Caps
and Minimum Team Salaries as the other 27 teams, except as fol-
lows:
             (1) 1995-96 Season:
             Salary Cap: 66 and 2/3\% of the Salary Cap determined
             in accordance with Section 2(a) above for the 1995-96
             Season ("1995 Expansion Team Salary Cap")

           son (" 1996 Expansion Team Salary Cap")
           Minimum Team Salary: 75\% of 1996 Expansion Team
           Salary Cap
       (d) Adjustments to Salary Cap and Minimum Team
           Salary.
           (1) (i) Beginning in the 1997-98 Season, in the event
   that Total Salaries and Benefits paid with respect to any Season
   is greater than 50.13\% of BRI for such Season, then for pur-
   poses of calculating the Calculated Salary Cap for the subse-
   quent Season, the amount of such overage shall be deducted
   from 48.04\% of Projected BRI for such subsequent Season less
   Projected Benefits (the "Overage Deduction"); provided, how-
   ever, that in no event shall the Overage Deduction reduce the
   Calculated Salary Cap for the subsequent Season by more than
   \$500,000. In the event that an Overage Deduction for any Sea-
   son exceeds \$500,000, there shall be no carry forward of any
   such excess to a subsequent Season.
                (ii) In the event that 48.04\% of actual BRI for a
   Season is less than 48.04\% of Projected BRI for that Season,
   then for purposes of calculating the Calculated Salary Cap for
   the subsequent Season, the difference shall be deducted from
   48.04\% of Projected BRI for such subsequent Season less Pro-
   jected Benefits. In the event that, in any Season, adjustments
   to 48.04\% of Projected BRI less Projected Benefits are called
   for pursuant to both this subsection (d)(1)(ii) and the preced-
   ing subsection (d)(I)(i), the maximum adjustment to 48.04\%
   of Projected BRI shall equal the greater of the adjustments
   called for under such subsections.
                (iii) In the event Total Salaries and Benefits paid
   with respect to any Season is less than 48.04\% of BRI for suchSeason (plus, if applicable, any shortfall against 48.04\% ofBRI
   for the prior Season), then for purposes Of calculating the Cal-
    culated Salary Cap for the subsequent Season, the amount of
   such shortfall shall be added to 48.04\% of Projected BRI for
   the subsequent Season less Projected Benefits; provided, how-
   ever, that in the event there is a shortfall with respect to the
    2000-01 Season, the amount of such shortfall shall be paid by
   the NBA to the Players Association for distribution to all NBA
   players who were on an NBA roster during the 2000-01 Season
   no later than September 1, 2001 on such proportional basis as
   may be reasonably determined by the Players Association.
                 (iv) In the event that actual Benefits for any Sea-
   son exceeds Projected Benefits for such Season, the difference
   shall be added to Projected Benefits for the SUbsequent Season.
                 (v) In the event that actual Benefits for any Season
    are less than Projected Benefits for such Season, the difference
   shall be deducted from Projected Benefits for the subsequent
   Season; provided, however, that in the event there is a shortfall
    with respect to the 2000-01 Season, the amount of such short-
   fall shall be paid by the NBA to the Players Association for
   distribution to all NBA players who were on an NBA roster
   during the 2000-01 Season no later than September 1, 2001 on
   such proportional basis as may be reasonably determined by
   the Players Association.
                 (vi) In the event that the Interim Salary Cap for a
   Season exceeds the Salary Cap for such Season, the difference
   shall be deducted from the Salary Cap (and, when applicable,
   the Interim Salary Cap) for the following Season.
Section 3.     Determination of Salary.
        For the purposes of determining a player's Salary with re-
spect to an NBA Season, the following rules shall apply:(a) Deferred Compensation.

   the Team after the playing term covered by the Contract, if any,
   and shall not include any compensation that the player is sched-
   uled to receive after the term of the Contract pursuant to such
   annuity compensation arrangement. The portion of the cost of
   the annuity paid by the Team while the player is required to
   render playing services under the Player Contract shall be in-
   cluded in Salary for the year in which such cost is paid.
            (2) Over 35 Rule: Notwithstanding any provision in
   a Player Contract to the contrary, the following provisions are
   applicable to any Player Contract entered into or extended that,
   going forward, covers four or more NBA Seasons, including

   or has reached age 35 (an "Over 35 Contract");
                (i) Except as provided in subsections (ii)-(iv) be-
   low, the aggregate Salaries in an Over 35 Contract for Seasons

the aggregate Salaries in such Over 35 Contract for Seasons
commencing with the fifth Season shall be' attributed to the prior
Seasons pro rata on the basis of the Salaries for such prior Sea-
sons.
              (iii) If a player who has played for his current Team
for at least ten consecutive Seasons enters into an Over 35 Con-
tract that is an Extension and that, beginning with the date the
Extension is signed, covers more than five NBA Seasons, the
aggregate Salaries in such Over 35 Contract for Seasons com-
mencing with the sixth Season shall be attributed to the prior
Seasons pro rata on the basis of the Salaries for such prior Sea-
sons.
              (iv) For each Season of an Over 35 Contract be-
ginning with the third Season prior to the First Zero Year (as
defined in subsection (vii) below), if the player plays in such
Season, then the Salaries of the player for the subsequent three
or fewer Seasons covered by the Contract (including any Zero
Year) shall, on the July 1 of the first subsequent Season, be
aggregated and attributed in equal shares to each of such three
or fewer Seasons.
              (v) Notwithstanding subsection (2)(i) above,
there shall be no re-allocation of Salaries pursuant to this
Section 3(a)(2) for:

   tract.
       (b) Signing Bonuses.
            (1) Amounts Treated as Signing Bonuses: For pur-
   poses of determining a player's Salary, the term "signing bo-
   nus" shall include:
                 (i) any amount specifically described in a Player
   Contract as a signing bonus;
                 (ii) any Option Buy-Out Amount;
                 (iii) at the time of an assignment of a Player Con-
   tract, any amount other than increases in remaining payments
   to be made pursuant to paragraph 3 of the Contract that, under
   the terms of the Contract, is earned in the form of a bonus upon
   assignment of the Contract; and
                 (iv) payments in excess of \$250,000 with respect
   to foreign players, in accordance with subsection (f) below.
            (2) Proration: Any signing bonus contained in a
   Player Contract shall be allocated in equal parts over the num-
   ber of Seasons (or remaining Seasons in the case of a signing
   bonus described in subsection (l)(iii) above) covered by such
   Contract that are fully protected for skill, provided, however,
   that no portion of a signing bonus contained in a Player Con-
   tract that provides for an Early Termination Option shall be
                                                                             ..';
                                                                        ___ ;59
allocated to any Season following the Effective Date of such
option. In the event that no Season covered by a Player Con-
tract is fully protected for skill, then the entire amount of the
signing bonus shall be allocated to the first Season of the Con-
tract or, in the case of a signing bonus described in subsection
(l)(iii) above, the Season during which the player's Contract is
assigned.
         (3) Signing Bonus Credits: Upon the occurrence of
an event that determines that a player shall not be entitled to
receive an Option Buy-Out Amount (the "non-payment deter-
mination"):
              (i) all amounts that were included in the player's
Salary pursuant to subsection (l)(ii) above for Seasons up
to and including the Season in which the non-payment de-
termination is made (the "unpaid amounts") shall be deducted
from the calculation of Total Salaries and Benefits for the Sea-
son in which the non-payment determination is made;
              (ii) all amounts that were included in the player's
Salary pursuant to subsection (l)(ii) above for Seasons follow-
ing the Season in which the non-payment determination is made
shall be deducted from the player's Salary for such Seasons;
and
              (iii) the unpaid amounts shall be deducted from the
Team's Team Salary, in accordance with the following:
                   (A) The total amount available to be deducted
from the Team's Team Salary (the "credit amount") will equal
the aggregate of the unpaid amounts less, for each Season in
which a portion of the unpaid amounts was included in the
player's Salary and in which his Team's Team Salary did not
fall below the Salary Cap, the smallest amount by which his
Team's Team Salary exceeded the Salary Cap during such Sal-
ary Cap Year.(B) The credit amount shall be allocated, in
   equal parts, over the same number of Seasons over which the
   unpaid amounts were allocated, beginning with the first Sea-
   son following the non-payment determination, plus, for each
   Season following the first Season of such allocation, 10\% of
   the amount allocated to the first Season.
                      (C) If, during the course of any Salary Cap Year
   in which a credit allocation has been made, the Team's Team
   Salary does not fall below the Salary Cap, the full credit allo-
   cation for such Salary Cap Year will be carried forward to a
   subsequent Salary Cap Year. If, during the course of a Salary
   Cap Year in which a credit allocation has been made, the Team's
   Team Salary does fall below the Salary Cap, the amount car-
   ried forward, if any, will equal the amount of the credit alloca-
   tion for such Season less the largest amount by which the Team's
   Team Salary fell below the Salary Cap during such Salary Cap
   Year. In the event a credit allocation is carried forward pursu-
   ant to this subsection, such amount shall be deducted from Team
   Salary in the Season immediately following the last Season in
   which a portion of the credit amount is then currently being
   allocated, subject to the terms of this subsection (iii)(C).
            (4) Extensions:
                 (i) In the event that a Team with a Team Salary at
   or over the Salary Cap enters into an Extension that calls for or
   contains a signing bonus, such signing bonus shall be paid no
   sooner than the first day of the Salary Cap Year covered by the
   extended term and shall be allocated, in equal parts, over the
   number of Seasons covered by the extended term that are fully
   protected for skill. In the event that no Season in the extended
   term is fully protected for skill, then the entire amount of the
   signing bonus shall be allocated to the first Season of the ex-
   tended term.
                 (ii) A Team with a Team Salary below the Salary
   Cap may enter into an Extension that calls for or contains a
                                                                       L jsigning bonus to be paid at any time during the Contract's origi-
   nal or extended term. In the event that· a Team with a Team
   Salary below the Salary Cap enters into an Extension that calls
   for or contains a signing bonus to be paid no sooner than the
   first day of the Salary Cap Year covered by such extended term,
   the bonus shall be allocated in accordance with the proration
   rules set forth in subsection (4)(i) above. In the event a Team
   with a Team Salary below the Salary Cap enters into an Exten-
    sion that calls for or contains a signing bonus to be paid prior
    to the first day of the Salary Cap Year covered by the exterided
   term, the following rules shall apply:
                     (A) The signing bonus shall be allocated in
    equal parts over the Seasons remaining under the original term
    of the Contract and the extended term that are fully protected
   for skill; and
                     (B) The Extension shall be deemed a Renego-
    tiation and shall be subject to the rules governing Renegotia-
    tions set forth in Section 7 below.
         (c) Loans to Players. The following rules shall apply to
any loan made by any Team to or at the direction of a player:
             (1) If any such loan bears no interest (or interest at an
    effective rate lower than 9\% per annum), then an amount equal
    to 9\% per annum of the outstanding balance (or an amount equal
    to the difference between 9\% per annum of the outstanding
    balance and the actual rate of interest to be paid by the player)
    shall be included in the player's Salary.
             (2) No loan made to a player after July 1, 1996 may
    (along with other outstanding loans to the player) exceed the
    amount of the player's Salary for the then-current Season that
    is fully protected for skill. All loans must be repaid through
    deductions from the player's remaining compensation over the
    term of the Contract (prior to the Effective Date of any Early
    Termination Option) in equal annual amounts (the "annual al-
    locable repayment amounts"). If a loan is made at a time whenthe remaining Salary due for the then-current Season that is
   fully protected for skill is less than the annual allocable repay-
   ment amount that would be owed on a loan for the full amount
   of the player's Salary that is, fully protected for skill for the
   then-current Season (the "maximum annual allocable repay-
   ment amount"), the maximum loan amount for that Season shall
   be reduced by the amount by which the maximum annual allo-
   cable repayment amount exceeds the amount of remaining Sal-
   ary that is fully protected for skill. (For example, if a Player
   has \$1 million in Salary in the first Season of a five-year Con-
   tract, and a loan is made during that Season at a time when the
   Player has already received his Salary for that Season, the loan
   may not exceed \$800,000.)
            (3) Any forgiveness by a Team of a loan to a player
   shall be deemed a Renegotiation in the Salary Cap Year of such
   forgiveness and shall be subject to the rules governing Renego-
   tiations set forth in Section 7 below.
        (d) Performance Bonuses.
            (1) For purposes of determining a player's Salary each
   Season, except as provided in subsections (2) through (4) be-
   low, any amounts that may be earned as a bonus based upon the
   performance of an individual player or a Team (provided such
   bonus may be included in a Player Contract in accordance with
   Section 5(f) below), shall be included in Salary only if such
   bonus would be earned if the Team's or player's performance
   were identical to the performance in the immediately preced-
   ing Season.
            (2) Notwithstanding subsection (1) above, in the event
   that, with respect to the first Season covered by a Contract or
   Renegotiation, or the first Season of an extended term, the NBA
   or the Players Association believes that the performance of a
   player and/or his team during the immediately preceding Sea-
   son does not fairly predict the likelihood of the player earning
   a performance bonus during the current Season, the NBA or          !: ~
                                                                      1-2_J63
the Players Association may request that a jointly selected bas-
ketball expert ("Expert") determine whether (i) in the case of
an NBA challenge, it is very likely that the bonus will be earned,
or (ii) in the case of a Players Association challenge, it is very
likely that the bonus will not be earned. The party initiating a
proceeding before the Expert shall carry the burden of proof.
The Expert shall render his determination within two weeks of
the initiation of the proceeding. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this subsection (2), no party may, in connection
with any proceeding before the Expert, refer to the facts that,
absent a challenge pursuant to this subsection (2), a bonus would
or would not be included in a player's Salary pursuant to sub-
section (1) above, or would be termed "Likely" or "Unlikely"
pursuant to Article I, Section l(z) or (bg). If, following an
NBA challenge, the Expert determines that a performance bo-
nus is very likely to be earned, the bonus shall be included in
the player's Salary. If, following a Players Association chal-
lenge, the Expert determines that a performance bonus is very
likely not to be earned, the bonus shall be excluded from the
Player's Salary. The Expert's determination that a bonus is
very likely to be earned or very likely not to be earned shall be
final, binding and unappealable. The fees and costs of the Ex-
pert in connection with any proceeding brought pursuant to this
subsection (2) shall be borne equally by the parties.
          (3) In the case of a Rookie or a Veteran who did not
play during the immediately preceding Season, a performance
bonus will be included in Salary if it is likely to be earned. In
the event that the NBA and the Players Association cannot agree
as to whether a bonus is likely to be earned, such dispute will
be referred to the Expert, who will determine whether the bo-
nus is likely to be earned or not likely to be earned. The Expert
shall render his determination within two weeks of the initia-
tion of the proceeding. The Expert's determination that a bo-
nus is likely to be earned or not likely to be earned shall be
final, binding and unappealable. The fees and costs of the Ex-~

   subsection (3) shall be borne equally by the parties.

   pursuant to subsection (2) or (3) above, the player's Salary plus
   the full amount of any disputed bonuses shall be included in
   Team Salary during the pendency of the proceeding.
            (5) In the event the NBA and the Players Association          .;
                                                                          ~

   sections (2) and (3) above may be filed with the Grievance
   Arbitrator in accordance with Article XXXI, Sections 2- 6.
            (6) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
   Section 3(d), bonuses and other compensation that are within
   the sole discretion of the player or unrelated to the performance
   of skilled basketball (such as weight bonuses, bonuses based
   upon academic achievement or compensation for off-Season
   workouts) shall be included in Salary.
        (e) Averaging. In accordance with the rules set forth in
   Section 5(e) below, a player's Salary for each of two or more
   Seasons shall be deemed in certain circumstances to be the av-
   erage of the aggregate Salaries payable for such Seasons.
        (f) Foreign Player Payments.
            (1) Any amount in excess of \$250,000 paid or to be
   paid by or at the direction of any NBA Team to (i) any basket-
   ball team other than an NBA Team, or (ii) any other entity,
   organization, representative or person, for the purpose of in-
   ducing a foreign player to enter into a Player Contract or in
   connection with securing the right to enter into a Player Con-
   tract with a foreign player (as defined in Article X, Section 6)
   shall be deemed Salary (in the form of a signing bonus) to the
   player.                                                              -  '1
                                                                        - j
            (2) Subject to Article XIII, any payment of \$250,000
   or less paid by or at the direction of any NBA Team pursuant tosubsection (1) above (the "\$250,000 exclusion"), shall not be
    deemed Salary to the player.
             (3) The \$250,000 exclusion may be paid in a single
    installment or in multiple installments. The \$250,000 exclu-
    sion, whether used in whole or in part, may be used by an NBA
    Team whenever it signs a foreign player to a new Player Con-
    tract, except that the \$250,000 exclusion may not be used, in
    whole or in part, more than once in any three-Season period
    with respect to the same foreign player.
             (4) The \$250,000 exclusion, or any part of it, shall be
    deemed to have been used as of the date of the Player Contract
    to which it applies, regardless of when it is actually paid. A
    schedule of payments relating to the \$250,000 exclusion, or
    any part of it, agreed upon at the time of the signing of the
    Player Contract to which it applies, shall not be deemed a mul-
    tiple use of the \$250,000 exclusion.
             (5) Notwithstanding subsection (1) above, no amount
    paid or to be paid pursuant to this subsection (f) shall be counted
    toward the Minimum Team Salary obligation of such Team in
    accordance with Section 2(b) or (c) above.
Section 4.     Determination of Team Salary.

    tion:

    tracts have been terminated pursuant to the NBA's waiver pro-cedure (without regard to any revised payment schedule that

                     (ii) Any amount paid to a retired player in accor-
        dance with the player's Player Contract.
                     (iii) Amounts paid pursuant to awards or judg-
        ments for, or settlements of, disputes between a Player and a
        Team concerning Salary obligations under a Player Contract
        (as allocated over time, where appropriate, in accordance with
        the terms of the judgment or settlement), except to the extent
        that such amounts were previously included in a player's Sal-
        ary.
                 (2) The aggregate Free Agent Amounts (as defined in
        subsection (d) below) attributable to Veteran Free Agents that
        last played for the Team.
                 (3) An amount with respect to a Team's unsigned First
        Round Pick, if any, as determined in accordance with sub-         -  1

        is deemed included in Team Salary in accordance with
        Section 6(j)(2) below.
             (b) Expansion. The Salary of any player selected by an
   Expansion Team in an expansion draft and terminated in accor-
   dance with the NBA waiver procedure before the first day of the
   Expansion Team's first Season shall not be included in the Expan-
   sion Team's Team Salary, except, to the extent such Salary is paid,
   for purposes of determining whether the Expansion Team has sat-
   isfied its Minimum Team Salary obligation for such Season.           I   ~j
             (c) Assigned Contracts. For purposes of calculating Team
   Salary, with respect to any Player Contract that is assigned, the
                                                                        I    l
                                                                        _   J67

entire Salary for the then-current Season and all future Seasons.

signs with his Team, signs with another NBA Team, or is renounced,
he will be included in his prior Team's Team Salary at one of the
following amounts ("Free Agent Amounts"):
             (1) A Qualifying Veteran Free Agent will be included
    at 150\% of his prior Salary if it was equal to or greater than the
    Estimated Average Player Salary, and 200\% of his prior Salary
    if it was less than the Estimated Average Player Salary.
             (2) An Early Qualifying Veteran Free Agent will be
    included at 130\% of his prior Salary; provided, however, that
    the player's prior Team may, by written notice to the NBA, re-
    nounce its rights to sign the player pursuant to the Early Quali-
    fying Veteran Free Agent Exception, in which case the player
    will be deemed a Non-Qualifying Veteran Free Agent for pur-
    poses of this Section 4( d) and Section 6(b) below.
             (3) A Non-Qualifying Veteran Free Agent will be in-
    cluded at 120\% of his prior Salary.
             (4) Notwithstanding subsections (1)-(3) above, if the
    player's prior Salary was equal to or less than the Minimum
    Annual Salary, he will be included at the then-current Season's
    Minimum Annual Salary.
             (5) For purposes of this subsection (d) only, a player's
    "prior Salary" means his Regular Salary for the prior Season
    plus any signing bonus allocation and the amount of any per-
    formance bonuses actually earned for such Season.
             (6) For purposes of this Section 4(d) only, in the event
    that a Veteran Free Agent's prior Contract provides for an in-
    crease or decrease in Salary between the second-to-last and last
    Seasons covered by the Contract of greater than \$4 million,'1
   such player's prior Salary shall be deemed to be equal to the
   average of the Salaries for the last two Seasons of the Contract.
        (e) First Round Picks.
            (1) Beginning with the 1995 Draft, a First Round Pick,
   immediately upon selection in the Draft, shall be included in
   the Team Salary of the Team that holds his draft rights at 100\%
   of his applicable Rookie Scale Amount, and, subject to subsec-       1
   tion (2) below, shall continue to be included in the Team Salary
   of any Team that holds his draft rights (including any Team to
   which the player's draft rights are assigned) until such time as
   the player signs with such Team or until the Team loses or as-
   signs its exclusive draft rights to the player.
            (2) In the event that a First Round Pick signs with a
   non-NBA team, the player's applicable Rookie Scale Amount
   shall be excluded from the Team Salary of the Team that holds
   his draft rights, beginning on the date he signs such non-NBA
   contract or the first day of the Regular Season, whichever is
   later, and shall be included again in his Team's Team Salary at
   the applicable Rookie Scale Amount on the following July 1 or
   the date the player's contract ends (or the player is released
   from his non-NBA contractual obligations), whichever is ear-
   lier, unless the Team relinquishes its exclusive rights to the
   player in accordance with Article X, Section 3(f). If, after such
   following July 1, or any subsequent July 1, the player signs
   another, or remains under, contract with a non-NBA team, the
   player's applicable Rookie Scale Amount will again be excluded
   from Team Salary beginning on the date of the contract signing
   or the first day of the Regular Season commencing after such
   July 1, whichever is later, and will again be included in Team
   Salary at the applicable Rookie Scale Amount on the following
   July I or the date the player's contract ends (or the player is
   released from his non-NBA contractual obligations), which-
                                                                        j
   ever is earlier, unless the Team relinquishes its exclusive rights
   to the player in accordance with Article X, Section 3(f).
                                                                          ::
                                                                        J(3) For purposes of this Section 4(e), the "applicable
    Rookie Scale Amount" for a First Round·Pick means, with re-
    spect to any Salary Cap Year, the Rookie Scale Amount that
    would apply if the player were drafted in the Draft immedi-
    ately preceding such Salary Cap Year at the same draft position
    at which he was actually selected.
         (f) Renouncing. To renounce a Veteran Free Agent, a
Team can, at any time, provide the NBA with an express, written
statement renouncing its right to re-sign the player, effective no
earlier than the July 1 following the last Season covered by the
Contract. (The NBA shall notify the Players Association of any
such renunciation by fax within two business days following re-
ceipt of notice of such renunciation.) In the event of a renuncia-
tion, the player's Prior Team (i) may not resign such player for 56
days after the first game of the following Season (or for 56 days
after the first game of the then-current Season in the event such
renunciation occurs after the start of the Season, but prior to the
56th day after the first game of such Season), and (ii) thereafter
may re-sign such player only to the extent of the Team's then-cur-
rent Room (i.e., the Team cannot sign such player pursuant to Sec-
tion 6(b) below).
         (g) Long-Term Injuries.        Any player who suffers a ca-
reer-ending injury or illness, and whose contract is terminated by
the Team in accordance with the NBA waiver procedure, will be
excluded from his team's Team Salary as follows:
             (1) If the injury or illness occurs on or after July 1, but
    prior to January 1 of any Season, then, beginning on the second
    July 1 following the injury or illness, the Team may apply to
    the NBA to have the player's Salary for each remaining Season
    of the Contract excluded from Team Salary. (For example, if
    the career-ending injury or illness occurs on August 1, 1996,
    the Team may apply to have the player's Salary excluded from
    Team Salary beginning on July 1, 1998.)(2) If the injury or illness occurs on or after January 1
   but prior to July 1 of any Season, then, beginning on the second
   anniversary of the injury or illness, the Team may apply to the
   NBA to have the player's Salary for each remaining Season of
   the Contract excluded from Team Salary.
            (3) The determination of whether a player has suffered
   a career-ending injury or illness shall be made by a physician
   selected jointly by the NBA and the Players Association.
            (4) Notwithstanding subsections (1) through (3) above,
   a player's Salary shall not be excluded from Team Salary if,
   after the date on which a career-ending injury or illness is al-
   leged to have occurred but before his Salary is excluded from
   Team Salary, the player played in more than ten NBA games in
   anyone Season or in a total of 15 games over two Seasons.
            (5) Notwithstanding subsections (1) through (3) above,
   if, after a player's Salary is excluded from Team Salary in ac-
   cordance with this Section 4(g), the player plays in 10 NBA
   games in anyone Season, the excluded Salary for that Season
   and each subsequent Season shall thereupon be included in Team
   Salary. If, after a player's Salary is excluded from Team Sal-
   ary in accordance with this Section 4(g), the player plays in 15
   or more NBA games over two Seasons but did not play in ten
   games in the first of such two Seasons, the excluded Salary for
   the second Season and each subsequent Season shall thereupon
   be included in Team Salary. After a player's Salary for one or
   more Seasons has been included in Team Salary in accordance
   with this subsection (5), the player's Team shall be permitted
   at the appropriate time to re-apply to have the player's Salary
   (for each Season remaining at the time of the re-application)
   excluded from Team Salary in accordance with the rules set
   forth in this subsection (g).
        (h) Summer Contracts.
            (1) Except as provided in subsection (2) below, from
   the day following the last day of a Season until the day prior to  ,-_J71
the first day of the next Regular Season, a Team may enter into
Player Contracts that will not be included in computing Team
Salary, provided that such Contracts satisfy the requirements
of this Section 4(h) (a "Summer Contract"). Except as set
forth in the following sentence, no Summer Contract may pro-
vide for (i) any compensation of any kind, including a signing
bonus, performance bonus or salary advance, that is or may be
paid or earned prior to the first day of the next Regular Season,
or (ii) salary protection or insurance of any kind. The only
consideration that may be provided to a player signed to a Sum-
mer Contract, prior to the start of the Regular Season, is per
diem, lodging, transportation, compensation in accordance with
paragraph 3(b) of the Uniform Player Contract, and a disabil-
ity insurance policy covering disabilities incurred while such
player participates in summer leagues or rookie camps for the
Team. No later than the day prior to the first day of a Regular
Season, a Team that has entered into one or more Summer Con-
tracts must terminate such Contracts except to the extent the
Team has Room for such Contracts.
         (2) A Team may not enter into a Summer Contract with
a Veteran Free Agent who last played for the Team unless the
Contract is for one Season only and provides for a Salary of no
more than the Minimum Annual Salary applicable to such Vet-
eran Free Agent.
     (i) Team Salary Summaries.
         (1) The NBA shall provide the Players Association with
Team Salary summaries and a list of current Exceptions and
Base Year Compensations once a month during the Regular
Season and once every two weeks during the off-season.
         (2) In the event that the NBA fails to provide the Play-
ers Association with any Team Salary summary or list of Ex-
ceptions or Base Year Compensations as provided for in sub-
section (1) above, the Players Association shall notify the NBA
of such failure, and the NBA, upon receipt of such notice, shall,-    1
       as soon as reasonably possible, but in no event later than two
       business days following receipt of such notice, provide the Play-
       ers Association with any such summary or list that should have        -l
       been provided pursuant to subsection (1) above.
                                                                             "1
                                                                                :1
   Section S.     Operation of Salary Cap
            (a) Basic Rule. A Team's Team Salary may not exceed
   the Salary Cap at any time unless the Team is using one of the
   Exceptions set forth in Section 6 below.
            (b) Room.      Subject to the provisions of this Section 5,       "'
   any Team with Room may enter into a Player Contract that calls
   for a Salary in the first Season of such Contract that would not
   exceed the Team's then-current Room.
            (c) 20\% Rule.
                (1) Except as provided in Sections 5(d) (Banked
       Room), 6(b)(1) (Qualifying Veteran Free Agent Exception), and
       7(b) (Rookie Scale Extensions) below, for each Season of a
       Player Contract after the first Season, and for each Season of
       an Extension after the first Season of the extended term (in-
       cluding, in either case, any Season following the Effective Date
       of an Option or an Early Termination Option), the player's Sal-
       ary, excluding performance bonuses, may increase over the pre-
       vious Season's Salary, excluding performance bonuses, by no
       more than (i) 20\% of the Regular Salary for the first Season of
       the Contract, or (ii) in the case of an Extension, 20\% of the
       Regular Salary for the last Season of the original term of the
       Contract.
                (2) In the event that the first Season of a Contract pro-
                                                                              j
       vides for performance bonuses, the total amount of Likely Bo-
       nuses in each subsequent Season of the Contract may increase
       by up to 20\% of the amount of Likely Bonuses in the first Sea-
       son, and the total amount of Unlikely Bonuses in each subse-
       quent Season may increase by up to 20\% of the amount of Un-likely Bonuses in the first Season. With respect to an Exten-
    sion, in the event that the last Season of the original term of the
    Contract provides for performance bonuses, the amount of
    Likely Bonuses and Unlikely Bonuses in each Season of the
    Extension after the first Season of the extended term may in-
    crease by up to 20\% of the amount of Likely Bonuses and Un-
    likely Bonuses, respectively, in the last Season of the original
    term.
        (d) Banked Room. In the event that the first Season of a
Player Contract results in Banked Room, the unused portion of such
Banked Room may be used in any subsequent Season to provide
for an increase in Salary and Unlikely Bonuses over the previous
Season's Salary in excess of that permitted by the 20\% Rule.
        (e) Averaging.
             (1) If, in accordance with Article VII, Section Sed)
    (Banked Room), 6(b)(1) (Qualifying Veteran Free Agent Ex-
    ception), or 7(b) (Rookie Scale Extensions), the Salary in any
    Season of a Player Contract after the first Season (or, in any
    Season of an Extension, after the first Season of the extended
    term), including any Season following the Effective Date of an
    Option or an Early Termination Option, increases or decreases
    over the previous Season's Salary by more than 20\% of Regu-
    lar Salary in the first Season of the Contract (or, in the case of
    an Extension, by more than 20\% of the Regular Salary in the
    last Season of the original term of the Contract), the player
    shall be deemed to have a Salary for each Season of the Con-
    tract (or extended term) equal to the average of the aggregate
    Salaries for each such Season.
             (2) If, in accordance with subsection (1) above, a Con-
    tract (or Extension) with an Early Termination Option would
    be subject to averaging but the average of the Salaries in the
    Seasons preceding the Effective Date of the Early Termination
    Option exceed the average of the Salaries in the Seasons fol-
    lowing the Effective Date of the Early Termination Option, then,notwithstanding subsection (1) above, only the Seasons pre-
   ceding the Effective Date of the Early Termination Option shall
   be averaged; provided, however, that if the player fails to exer-
   cise the Early Termination Option and his Salary increases or
   decreases in any Season following the Effective Date of the
   Early Termination Option by more than 20\% of the Regular
   Salary in the first Season of the Contract, the player shall be
   deemed to have a Salary for each Season following the Effec-      -- ---::
   tive Date of the Early Termination Option equal to the average
   of the aggregate Salaries for the Seasons following the Effec-
   tive Date of the Early Termination Option.
            (3) In the event a Rookie Scale Contract is extended
   pursuant to Section 7(b) below, and the Contract is assigned to
   another Team prior to the subsequent July 1, the player subject
   to such Contract shall be deemed to have a Salary for the last
   Season of the original term of the Contract and the extended
   term equal to the average of the aggregate Salaries for such
   Seasons.
            (4) A Contract that is not subject to averaging at the
   time it is entered into shall not later be subject to averaging,
   other than as a result of a Renegotiation or Extension. An Av-
   eraged Contract shall not later be de-averaged notwithstanding
   any subsequent renegotiation of such Contract.
       (f) Performance Bonuses.
            (1) No Team may enter into a Player Contract contain-
   ing a performance bonus for the first Season of the Contract
   that, if earned or paid during the first Season covered by such
   Contract, would result in the Team's Team Salary exceeding
   the Room under which it is signing the Contract. For the sole
                                                                         j
   purpose of determining whether a Team has Room for a new
   Unlikely Bonus, the Team's Room shall be deemed reduced by
   all Unlikely Bonuses in Contracts approved by the Commis-             j

                (1) If the player is a Qualifying Veteran Free Agent,        1
       the new Player Contract may provide for Salary of any amount
       for any Season of the Contract.                                    - -~

       place a player who, as a result of a Disabling Injury or Illness
       (as defined below), is unable to render playing services (the
       "Disabled Player"). Such Replacement Player's Contract may77
provide a Salary for the first Season of up to the lesser of
(i) 50\% of the Disabled Player's Salary at the time the Dis-
abling Injury or Illness occurred, or (ii) 108\% of the Average
Player Salary for the prior Season (or, if the prior Season's
Average Player Salary has not been determined, 108\% of the
Estimated Average Player Salary for the prior Season). Salary

             (ii) for the period December 1 through the imme-
diately following June 30, any injury or illness that will render
a player unable to play all of the following Season.
         (3) The Exception for a Disabling Injury or Illness that
occurs during the period July 1 through the immediately fol-
lowing November 30 shall arise on the date the Team knew or
reasonably should have known that the injury or illness would
cause the player to miss the then-current (or upcoming) Sea-
son, and shall expire 45 days from the date the Exception arises.
         (4) The Exception for a Disabling Injury or Illness that
occurs during the period December 1 through the immediately
following June 30 shall arise on the date the Team knew or rea-
sonably should have known that the injury or illness would cause
the player to miss all of the following Season; provided, how-
ever, that if the Team knew or reasonably should have known
prior to the July 1 immediately following the injury or illness
that the injury or illness would cause the player to miss all of
the following Season, and if the Team does not use the Excep-
tion prior to such July 1, then the Exception shall be deemed to
arise on July 1. The Exception for a Disabling Injury or Ill-ness that occurs during the period December 1 through the im-
       mediately following June 30 shall expire-on the October 1 im-
       mediately following the date on which the Exception arises.
                (5) The determination of whether a player has suffered
       a Disabling Injury or Illness shall be made by a physician des-
       ignated by the NBA. The NBA shall advise the Players Asso-
       ciation of the determination of its physician within one busi-
                                                                         -- 1
       ness day of such determination. In the event the Players Asso-
       ciation disputes the NBA physician's determination, the par-
       ties will immediately refer the matter to a neutral physician (to
       be selected by the parties at the commencement of each Salary
       Cap Year) to review the relevant medical information and, if
       requested, examine the player and render, within three busi-
       ness days of his receipt of such information, a final determina-
       tion, which will be final, binding and unappealable. The cost
       of the NBA physician will be borne by the NBA. The cost of
       the neutral physician will be borne jointly by the NBA and the
       Players Association.
                (6) Notwithstanding a determination by a physician
       designated by the NBA that a player has suffered a Disabling
       Injury or Illness, such player, upon recovering from his injury
       or illness, may be restored to his Team's active list, without
       affecting any right the Team may have to sign a Replacement
       Player.
                (7) In no event maya Team enter into a Contract with
       a Replacement Player pursuant to subsection (c)(4), unless the

   acquisition of one or more Replacement Players do not occur
   simultaneously, then the post-assignment Salary or aggregate
   Salaries of the Replacement Player(s) for the Salary Cap Year         -~

   notwithstanding subsection (j) below, a Team with a Team Sal-

subsection (2) above, and notwithstanding subsection (j) be-
low, a Team with a Team Salary below the Salary Cap may (i)
replace a Traded Player with one or more Replacement Players
whose Player Contracts are acquired simultaneously and whose
post-assignment Salaries for the then-current Season, in the
aggregate, are no more than an amount equal to 115\% of the
pre-assignment Salary of the Traded Player, plus \$100,000, or
(ii) aggregate the pre-assignment Salaries in two or more Player
Contracts for the purpose of acquiring in a simultaneous trade
one or more Replacement Players whose post-assignment Sala-
ries, in the aggregate, are no more than an amount equal to
115\% of the pre-assignment aggregated Salaries of the Traded
Players, plus \$100,000. Notwithstanding the preceding sen-
tence, no Player Contract signed or acquired pursuant to an
Exception, other than the Veteran Free Agent Exception set forth

   guished pursuant to subsection (4)(ii)(D) below; or

   on some future date based upon an Extension entered into prior to       -1
   the effective date of this Agreement.
                (ii) A player's Base Year Compensation shall be
   computed as follows:
                     (A) During the first 365 days from the date a

   Salary for the last Season of his preceding Contract or, in the
   case of an Extension, the last Season of the original term of the
   Contract (the preceding amount hereinafter referred to as the
   "Base Year Salary"), or (2) one-third of the Salary for Year One
   of his new Contract (or extended term, if applicable).
                     (B) During the second 365 days from the date
   the player's Base Year Compensation goes into effect ("Year

   (1) 120\% of his Base Year Salary, or (2) two-thirds of the Sal-
   ary for Year Two of his new Contract (or extended term, if ap-
   plicable).
                     (C) A player's Base Year Compensation will
   expire and be of no further effect on the 731st day of his new
   Contract (or extended term, if applicable).
                     (D) A player subject to a Base Year Compensa-
   tion as of the effective date of this Agreement in accordance with
   subsection (4 )(i)(C) above shall be treated as if the phase-out rule
   set forth above was in effect when such Base Year Compensa-
   tion came into effect.
                (iii) In the event a player who is subject to a Base
   Year Compensation during the last Season of his Contract signsan Extension or a new Player Contract with his Prior Team, the

    (B) in the case of an Extension, the 730th day from the date the
    player's Base Year Compensation went into effect; provided,
    however, that in the event the player is a Qualifying Veteran
    Free Agent or an Early Qualifying Veteran Free Agent, and the
    new Contract would itself subject the player to a Base Year
    Compensation in accordance with subsection (4 )(i)(A) above, then
    the player shall be subject to a new Base Year Compensation for a

from further association with the NBA in accordance with Sec-
tion 1 of the NBA/NBPA Anti-Drug Agreement is later reinstated84                                                                         (-;:

                                                                            .--  ~
   pursuant to Section 9 of that Agreement, the Team for which the
   player last played may enter into a Player Contract, in accordance
   with the rules set forth in Section 9 of the NBA/NBPA Anti-Drug
   Agreement, with such player that provides for a Salary for the first
   Season of up to the player's Salary for the Salary Cap Year in which
   he was disqualified, even if the Team has a Team Salary at or above
   the Salary Cap or such Player Contract causes the Team to have a
   Team Salary above the Salary Cap. If, in accordance with the pre-
   ceding sentence, a Team and a player enter into a Player Contract
   and such Contract covers more than one Season, increases in Sal-
   ary for Seasons following the first Season shall be governed by the
   20\% Rule.
            (i) Non-Aggregation. Other than in accordance with sub-
   section (g) above, a Team may not aggregate or combine any of the
   Exceptions set forth above in order to sign one or more players at
   Salaries greater than that permitted by anyone of the Exceptions.
   If a Team has more than one Exception available at the same time,
   the Team shall have the right to choose which Exception it wishes
   to use to sign a player.
            U) Other Rules.
                 (1) A Team shall be entitled to use the Disabled Player,
        \$1 Million, and Assigned Player Exceptions set forth in sub-
        sections (c), (d) and (g) above, respectively, except as set forth
        in subsections (g)(2) and (3) above, only if, at the time any
        such Exception arises and at all times until it is used, (i) the
        Team's Team Salary is at or above the Salary Cap, or (ii)
        the amount by which the Team's Team Salary is below the Sal-
        ary Cap is less than the amount that would be available to the
        Team in accordance with the Exception.
                 (2) In the event that, when a Disabled Player Excep-
        tion, \$1 Million Exception or Assigned Player Exception arises,
        the Team's Team Salary is below the Salary Cap (or in the event
        that, prior to the expiration of any such Exception, the Team's
        Team Salary falls below the Salary Cap) by less than the amount
                                                                            ,-  -.:;;of such Exception, then (i) the Team's Team Salary shall in-
    clude, until the Exception is actually used or until the Team no
    longer is entitled to use the Exception, the amount of the Ex-
    ception (or any unused portion of the Exception), and (ii) the
    amount by which the Team's Team Salary is less than the Sal-
    ary Cap shall thereby be extinguished. When the Disabled
    Player Exception is used to sign or acquire a player, the Re-
    placement Player's Salary for the first Season of his Contract,
    instead of the amount of the Exception, shall be included in
    Team Salary. When a \$1 Million Exception or an Assigned
    Player Exception is used to sign or acquire a player, respec-
    tively, the Salary for the first Season of the signed or acquired
    Contract plus any unused portion of the Exception, instead of
    the full amount of the Exception, shall be included in Team
    Salary. A Team may at any time renounce its rights to use an
    Exception, in which case the Exception (or any unused portion
    of the Exception) no longer will be included in Team Salary.
Section 7.     Renegotiations and Extensions.

    four or five years may be extended beginning on the third anni-
    versary of the signing of the Contract.
             (2) A Player Contract that has been extended, or that
    has been renegotiated to provide for an increase in Salary or
    performance bonuses in any Season of the Contract of more
    than 10\%, may not subsequently be extended until the third

                                                                          i!

   section (1) or (2) above may, in the first Season of the extended
   term, provide for a Salary of up to 120\% of the Regular Salary

   event that the last Season of the original term of the Contract
   provides for performance bonuses, the first Season of the ex-
   tended term may provide for Likely Bonuses and Unlikely Bo-
   nuses of up to 120\% of the Likely Bonuses and Unlikely Bo-
   nuses, respectively, in the last year of the original term. The
   permissible increases in Salary and performance bonuses in the
   subsequent Seasons of the extended term shall be governed by
   the 20\% Rule.
            (4) Notwithstanding subsection (3) above:
                (i) any Player Contract that, pursuant to the Salary
   Cap rules, has been averaged as of the effective date of this
   Agreement (including Contracts that begin with the 1995-1996
   Season) may, in the first Season of an extended term, provide
   for a Salary of up to the greater of (A) 120\% of the averaged
   Regular Salary in the last Season of the original term of the
   Contract, or (B) 120\% of what the Regular Salary would have
   been in the last Season of the original term had the Contract
   not been averaged, plus, in either case, 120\% of any perfor-
   mance bonuses provided for in the last Season of such Con-
   tract in accordance with subsection (3) above; and
                (ii) any Player Contract of a player who has played
   for his current Team for at least ten Seasons and whose Salary
   in the last Season of the original term of the Contract is less
   than the Salary in the second-to-Iast Season of such Contract
   may, in the first Season of an extended term, provide for a Sal-
   ary equal to 120\% of the greater of (1) the average of the Regu-lar Salaries for each Season covered by the original Contract
     beginning with the Season in which such 'Contract was entered
     into, or previously extended, as the case may be, or (2) the
     Regular Salary in the last Season covered by his original Con-
     tract, plus, in either case and subject to the foregoing limita-
     tions, 120\% of any performance bonuses called for in the last
     Season of such Contract in accordance with subsection (3)
     above.
          (b) Rookie Scale Extensions.      A First Round Pick may
enter into an extension of a Rookie Scale Contract during the pe-
riod July 1 to October 1 following the second Season of such Con-
tract. Such an Extension may provide for any amount of Salary in
each Season of the extended term.
          (c) Renegotiations. No Player Contract may be renego-
tiated except in accordance with the following:
              (1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3) below, a Player
     Contract covering a term of four or more Seasons may be rene-
     gotiated beginning on the third anniversary of the signing of
     the Contract.
              (2) Subject to subsection (3) below, any Player Con-
     tract that has been renegotiated in accordance with subsection
     (1) above to provide for an increase in Salary or performance
    bonuses in any Season of the Contract of more than 10\%, or
    extended in accordance with subsections (a) and (b) above, may
     not subsequently be renegotiated until the third anniversary of
     such Extension or Renegotiation.
              (3) Assuming subsections (1) or (2) above are satis-
     fied, a Team with a Team Salary below the Salary Cap may
     renegotiate a Player Contract by increasing the player's Regu-
     lar Salary or providing Likely Bonuses or Unlikely Bonuses in
     an amount not to exceed, in the aggregate, the Team's Room in
     the then-current Season and, for each subsequent Season, in-
     creasing the player's Regular Salary, Likely Bonuses and Un-
     likely Bonuses by the amount of the increase in Salary, LikelyBonuses and Unlikely Bonuses, respectively, for the then-cur-
   rent Season, plus, for each such subsequent Season, 20\% of the
   increase in Regular Salary, Likely Bonuses and Unlikely Bo-
   nuses, respectively, in the then-current Season.
            (4) In no event may a Team with a Team Salary at or
   above the Salary Cap renegotiate a Player Contract.
       (d) Other.

   crease in Salary for the then-current Season or for any remain-
   ing Season of a Player Contract.
            (2) A Player Contract that is extended pursuant to sub-
   section (a) above may be renegotiated simultaneously, but only
   in accordance with the rules set forth in subsection (c) above.
            (3) For the sole purpose of enabling an assignee
   Team to acquire a Player Contract by trade, the player and
   the assignor Team may agree to waive all or any portion of
   an assignment bonus, but only to the extent necessary to
   make the trade permissible in accordance with the rules set
   forth in Section 6(g) above. In the event that, in connection
   with a trade, a player's Contract is amended in accordance
   with this subsection (3), such Contract may not be subse-
   quently extended or renegotiated until the later of (i) six
   months from the date of the assignment, or (ii) the first date
   on which the Contract could otherwise be extended or rene-
   gotiated pursuant to this Section 7.
            (4) A Team and a player may at any time agree to amend
   a Player Contract to provide that, in exchange for reducing the
   amount of (or eliminating) the player's salary protection, the
   Team will terminate the Contract in accordance with the NBA
   waiver procedure.
            (5) In no event shall a Team and player amend a Con-
   tract for the purpose of terminating or shortening the term ofthe Contract, except in accordance with the NBA waiver pro-
   cedure or Article XII, Section 2.
            (6) Except to the extent a Team's Team Salary is be-
   low the Salary Cap, no Salary for any Season covered by the
   extended term of a Contract may be paid during the original
   term, including, without limitation, signing bonuses.
            (7) For purposes of this Section 7, if a Player Contract
   is signed after the beginning of a Season, the Season in which
   the Contract is signed shall be counted as one full Season cov-
   ered by the Contract.
Section 8.    Accounting Procedures.
        (a) (1) The NBA and the Players Association shall jointly
   engage an independent auditor (the "Accountants") to provide
   the parties with an "Audit Report" setting forth BRI, Team Sal-
   ary and Benefits of each NBA team for the immediately pre-
   ceding Season. The Audit Report is to be prepared in accor-
   dance with the provisions and definitions contained in this
   Agreement. The engagement of the Accountants shall be
   deemed to be renewed annually unless they are discharged by
   either party during the period from the submission of an Audit
   Report up to January 1 of the following year. The parties agree
    to share equally the costs incurred by the Accountants in pre-
   paring the Audit Report.
            (2) The Accountants shall submit a draft Audit Report
   to the NBA and the Players Association, along with relevant
    supporting documentation, on or before the July 31 following
   the conclusion of each Salary Cap Year. The final Audit Report
    shall be submitted by the Accountants to the parties on or be-
   fore the following August 15. The NBA, the Players Associa-
    tion and the Teams shall use their best efforts to facilitate the
    Accountants' timely completion of the Audit Report. Begin-
    ning with the Audit Report for the 1996-97 Salary Cap Year, in-1
       the event that, for any reason, the Accountants fail to submit to
       the parties a final Audit Report by August 15, the Accountants
       shall prepare an interim Audit Report (the "Interim Audit Re-
       port") by such date setting forth the Accountants' best estimate
       of BRI and Total Salaries and Benefits for such Salary Cap Year.
       Such Interim Audit Report shall include:
                    (i) All amounts of BRI and Total Salaries and Ben-
       efits for such Salary Cap Year as to which the Accountants have
       completed their review and, by written agreement of the Play-
       ers Association and the NBA (waiving their respective rights to
       dispute such amounts), are not in dispute.
                    (ii) With respect to any amounts that are in dispute
       (whether such dispute would be for the Accountants or the Sys-
       temArbitrator to decide under this Agreement), the NBA's good
       faith proposal as to the proper amount that should be included
       in the Audit Report.
                    (iii) With respect to any amounts as to which the
       Accountants have not yet completed their review, the portion
       of such amount, if any, as to which the Accountants have com-
       pleted their review and, by written agreement of the Players
       Association and the NBA (waiving their respective rights to
       challenge such portion), are not in dispute.
                    (iv) A projected amount for national broadcast and
       network cable television revenues, as determined in accordance
       with Article VII, Section l(a)(6).
            As soon as practicable after the Interim Audit Report is
   submitted to the parties, the Accountants shall submit the final Audit
   Report, including a description of the differences, if any, from the
   Interim Audit Report.
            (b) For purposes of determining BRI and Total Salaries and
   Benefits, the Accountants shall perform at least such review proce-
   dures as shall be agreed upon by the parties. In connection with
   the preparation of Audit Reports for each Salary Cap Year, each
                                                                          -- j91
Team and the NBA shall submit a report to the Accountants, the
NBA and the Players Association setting forth BRI, Team Salaries
and Benefits information for such Salary Cap Year on forms agreed
upon by the NBA, the Players Association and the Accountants (the
"BRI Reports").
        (c) The Accountants shall review the reasonableness of any
estimates of revenues or expenses for a Season included in any
Team's and the NBA's BRI Reports for such Season and may make
such adjustments in such estimates as they deem appropriate. To
the extent the actual amounts of revenues received or expenses in-
curred for a Season differ from such estimates, adjustments shall
be made in BRI for the following Salary Cap Year in accordance
with the provisions of subsection (g) below.
        (d) With respect to expenses deducted by the NBA or the
Teams, the NBA and the Teams shall report in BRI Reports only
those expenses that are reasonable and customary in accordance
with the provisions of Article VII, Section l(a)(l). Subject to the
terms of Article VII, Section 1(a)(3) (Expense Ratios) and Section
9 (Players Association Audit Rights), all categories of expenses
deducted in a BRI Report completed by the NBA or a Team shall
be reviewed by the Accountants, but such categories shall be pre-
sumed to be reasonable and customary and the amount of the ex-
penses deducted by the NBA or a Team that come within such ex-
pense categories shall also be presumed to be reasonable and cus-
tomary, unless such categories or amounts are found by the Ac-
countants to be either unrelated to the revenues involved or grossly
excessive.
        (e) The Accountants shall notify designated representatives
of the NBA and the Players Association: (i) if the Accountants
have any questions concerning the amounts of revenues or expenses
reported by the Teams and the NBA or any other information con-
tained in the BRI Reports; or (ii) if the Accountants propose that
any adjustments be made to any revenue or expense item or any
other information contained in the BRI Reports.(f) In the event of any dispute concerning the amounts (as
   opposed to includability or the interpretation, validity or applica-
   tion of this Agreement) of any revenues or expenses to be included
   in the BRI Reports that cannot be resolved among the parties (here-
   inafter referred to as "Disputed Adjustments"), such dispute shall
   be resolved by the Accountants after consulting and meeting with
   representatives of both parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ei-
   ther party shall have the right to contest, by commencing a pro-       ,- ~
   ceeding before the System Arbitrator pursuant to the provisions of
   Article XXXII of this Agreement, any Disputed Adjustments made
   by the Accountants whenever such Disputed Adjustments for all
   Teams are adverse to the party commencing the proceeding in an
   aggregate amount of \$5 million or more for any Season covered by
   this Agreement. If the Disputed Adjustments for all Teams are ad-
   verse to the party commencing the proceeding in an aggregate
   amount of \$5 million or more but less than \$10 million for any
   Season of the Agreement, the parties agree that: (i) the hearing
   will take place on an expedited basis and will not last longer than
   one full day, provided, however, that if, despite the reasonable ef-
   forts of the parties, the hearing cannot be completed in one day, the
   hearing shall continue, unless the parties otherwise agree, day-to-
   day until concluded; and (ii) if the party that brings the proceeding
   does not prevail after the hearing, then that party shall pay the rea-
   sonable costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, of the other
   party for its defense of the proceeding. The immediately preced-
   ing sentence shall have no application to proceedings in which the
   Disputed Adjustments for all Teams adverse to the party bringing
   the proceeding equal or exceed \$10 million in the aggregate. All
   other disputes among the parties as to the interpretation, validity,
   or application of this Agreement, or with respect to any Salary or
   Benefits amount included in a BRI Report, shall be resolved exclu-
   sively pursuant to the dispute resolution procedures of Article
   XXXII.
            (g) The Accountants shall indicate which amounts included
   in BRI for a Season, if any, represent estimates of revenues. With
   respect to any such estimated revenues, the Accountants shall, in93
preparing the Audit Report for the immediately succeeding Season
("Subsequent Audit Report"), determine the actual revenues re-
ceived for the prior Season and include in such Subsequent Audit
Report the amount of the aggregate difference, if any, between all
such estimated revenues for the prior Season and the actual rev-
enues received for such Season (the "Estimated Revenue Adjust-
ment").
Section 9.     Players Association Audit Rights.
         (a) Team Audits. The Players Association shall have the
right as part of the annual review of BRI Reports to retain its own
accountants (the "Players Association's Accountants"), at its own
expense, after the submission of each Audit Report under this Agree-
ment (the "First Audit"), to audit the books and records of at least
five NBA teams (of its choosing) and shall also have the right to
review the books and records of the NBA League Office, provided,
however, that such review shall be limited to (i) revenue items, and
(ii) expense items that appear in the BRI Reports. In the event that,
in the opinion of the Players Association's Accountants, such audit
indicates misallocations or miscategorizations of revenues or ex-
penses (other than with respect to matters that constituted Dis-
puted Adjustments in connection with the prior Audit Report)
resulting in an understatement of BRI in excess of \$1.5 million,
they shall submit to the NBA proposed adjustments to BRI consis-
tent with their findings. In the event that the NBA disputes such
proposed adjustments, such proposed adjustments shall be deemed
to be "Disputed Adjustments" and shall be resolved in accordance
with the procedures of Section 8(f) above. In addition, in the
event that First Audit Disputed Adjustments in excess of \$1.5
million are resolved in favor of the Players Association, the Play-
ers Association shall then have the right, that Season, to have the
Players Association's Accountants audit an additional five NBA
teams, in accordance with the foregoing procedures (the "Second
Audit"). If, as a result of the Second Audit, additional Disputed
Adjustments in excess of \$1.5 million are resolved in favor of the,- -'"Tj
   Players Association, the Players Association shall then have the
   right, that Season, to have the Players Association's Accountants
   audit all remaining NBA Teams. The amount of any and all Dis-
   putedAdjustments that are ultimately resolved in favor of the Play-
   ers Association in accordance with this Section 9(a) shall be added
   to BRI in the Season in which such resolution is reached.
            (b) Expense Audit. The Players Association shall have
   the right to retain the Players Association's Accountants to con-
   duct one audit, at its own expense, of the expenses incurred in con-
   nection with the proceeds that come within Article VII, Section
   l(a)(l)(viii) regardless of whether such expenses exceed the appli-
   cable Expense Ratios set forth in Exhibit C. In the event that in
   the opinion of the Players Association's Accountants, such audit
   indicates a misallocation or miscategorization of expenses result-
   ing in an understatement of BRI, they shall submit proposed ad-
   justments to the NBA consistent with their findings. In the event
   the NBA disputes such proposed adjustments, such proposed ad-
   justments shall be deemed to be DisputedAdjustments and resolved
   in accordance with the procedures of Section 8(f) above. The
   amount of any and all such Disputed Adjustments that are resolved
   in the Players Association's favor shall be included in BRI in the
   year in which such resolution is reached. In addition, in the event
   that any such Disputed Adjustments are resolved in the Players
   Association's favor, the Accountants shall be directed to correct
   such expense misallocations and/or miscategorizations in the re-
   maining Seasons of the Agreement.
            (c) System Arbitrator Review. Notwithstanding the fore-
   going procedures, in the event that any of the Disputed Adjust-
   ments set forth in this Section 9 concern the includability or the
   interpretation, validity or application of this Agreement, such Dis-
   puted Adjustments shall be resolved by the System Arbitrator.
