Section 1.     Scope.
         (a) Any dispute (such dispute hereinafter being referred to
as a "Grievance") involving the interpretation or application of, or
compliance with, the provisions of this Agreement or the provi-
sions of a Player Contract (except as provided in paragraph 9 of a
Uniform Player Contract), including a dispute concerning the va-
lidity of a Player Contract, shall be resolved exclusively by the
Grievance Arbitrator in accordance with the procedures set forth in
this Article; provided, however, that disputes arising under Articles
VII, VIII, X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, XVI, XXXVI, XXXVIII,
and XXXIX shall be determined by the System Arbitrator pro-
vided for in Article XXXII.
         (b) The Grievance Arbitrator shall also have jurisdiction
over disputes involving player discipline, to the extent set forth in
Section 8 below.
Section 2.     Initiation.
         (a) Grievances may be initiated, as set forth below, by a
player, a Team, the NBA, or the Players Association, except that
the Players Association may not initiate a Grievance involving
player discipline without the approval of the player(s) concerned.
         (b) No party may initiate a Grievance until and unless it
has first discussed the matter with the party or parties against whom
the Grievance is to be initiated in an attempt to settle it.
         (c) A Grievance must be initiated within twenty (20) days
from the date ofthe occurrence upon which the Grievance is based,
or within twenty (20) days from the date upon which the facts of
the matter became known or reasonably should have become known
to the party initiating the Grievance, whichever is later.(d) Subject to the provisions of Sections 2(a)-(c) above,
    (i) a player or the Players Association may initiate a Grievance by
    filing written notice thereof with a Team and furnishing a copy of      ,-   l
    such notice to the NBA; (ii) a Team may initiate a Grievance by
    filing written notice thereof with the Players Association and fur-
    nishing copies of such notice to the player(s) involved and to the
    NBA; and (iii) the NBA may initiate a Grievance by filing written
    notice thereof with the Players Association and furnishing copies
    of such notice to the player(s) and Team(s) involved.
    Section 3.     Hearings.
             (a) Within thirty (30) days of the date on which the Griev-
    ance Arbitrator is appointed, and on each successive anniversary
    date thereafter, the Arbitrator shall designate two (2) hearing dates
    per month (for the next twelve (12) months) for use by the parties
    to this Agreement. In addition, the Grievance Arbitrator shall be
    available for expedited hearings when necessary.
             (b) Either the NBA or the Players Association, upon at least
    thirty (30) days' written notice to the other side and to the Griev-
    ance Arbitrator, may arrange to have a hearing scheduled on one of
    the specific dates that the Arbitrator has reserved. If the other party
    is not prepared to go forward on that date, it may request a post-
    ponement of the hearing to a subsequent date certain, but no later
    than 30 days from the date on which the hearing was originally
    scheduled; postponement may be opposed by the party who origi-
    nally scheduled the Grievance, in which case the request will be
    referred to the Arbitrator for a decision.
             (c) If a Grievance is set for hearing and the hearing date is
    then postponed by a party, the postponement fee (if any) of the
    Arbitrator will be borne by the postponing party unless that party
    objects and the Arbitrator finds that the postponement was for good
    cause. Should good cause be found, the parties will share any post-
    ponement costs equally.
                                                                                  ~I
                                                                             --- j
                                                                             _    ..(d) No party may request or be granted more than two post-
ponements of any previously-scheduled heari:ng. If, after request-
ing and receiving two hearing postponements, a party fails to at-
tend a third scheduled hearing, the Grievance shall be resolved
against that party.
        (e) If the Grieving party does not request a hearing that is
scheduled to take place within one year of the filing of the Griev-
ance, or, in the case of a postponement of the first hearing date, if
the Grieving party does not request a second hearing that is sched-
uled to occur within two years of the filing of the Grievance, the
Grievance shall be dismissed with prejudice. Any Grievance filed
prior to the execution date of this Agreement shall be dismissed
with prejudice unless the Grieving Party schedules a hearing to
take place within one year of the execution of this Agreement. For
purposes of computing time under this subsection, the time shall
be tolled during any period when there is no Grievance Arbitrator
or when the Grieving party has been unable to schedule a hearing
(after making efforts to do so) because the Grievance Arbitrator is
unavailable.
        (f) Hearings before the Grievance Arbitrator shall be held
in New York (alternating between the NBA and Players Associa-
tion offices). All such hearings shall be conducted in accordance
with the Voluntary Labor Arbitration Rules of the American Arbi-
tration Association.
Section 4.     Procedure.
         (a) Not later than seven (7) days prior to the hearing, the
parties shall submit to the Grievance Arbitrator a joint statement of
the issue(s) in dispute. If the parties cannot agree on such a joint
statement, they shall each submit separate statements setting forth
the disputed issue(s).
         (b) Not later than three (3) business days prior to the hear-
ing, the parties shall exchange witness lists, relevant documents,
and citations of legal authorities that the parties intend to rely on.- --:;l
    Absent a showing of good cause, no party may proffer the testi-               .:
                                                                                  J

    briefs in any case.
    Section 5.     Arbitrator's Decision and Award.
             (a) Except as set forth in Section 10 below, the Grievance
    Arbitrator shall render an Award as soon as practicable, but in no
    event more than thirty (30) days following the conclusion of a Griev-
    ance hearing or the submission of post-hearing briefs where appli-
    cable. That Award may be accompanied by a written opinion, or
    the written opinion may follow within a reasonable time thereafter.
    The Award shall constitute full, final and complete disposition of
    the Grievance, and shall be binding upon the player(s) and Team(s)
    involved and the parties to this Agreement.
                                                                                "
             (b) The Grievance Arbitrator shall have jurisdiction and
    authority only to: (i) interpret, apply, or determine compliance
    with the provisions of this Agreement; (ii) interpret, apply or de-
    termine compliance with the provisions of Player Contracts; (iii)
    determine the validity of Player Contracts pursuant to Section 1 of
    this Article; (iv) award damages in connection with a proceeding
    provided for in Section 11 below; (v) award declaratory relief in
    connection with a proceeding initiated by a Team to determine
    whether such Team may properly terminate a Player Contract pur-
    suant to paragraphs 16(a)(i) or 16(a)(iii) of such Contract, and what,
    if any, liability such Team would incur as a result of such ter-
    mination; and (vi) resolve disputes arising under Article XXII,
    Section 5 and Article XXVI of this Agreement and the NBA/NBPA
    Anti-Drug Agreement in the manner set forth therein. The Griev-               J
    ance Arbitrator shall not have jurisdiction or authority to add to,
    detract from, or alter in any way the provisions of this Agreement
                                                                            -      "
                                                                                   -'
    or any Player Contract.(c) In any Grievance that involves an action taken by the
Commissioner (or his designee) concerning (i) the preservation of
the integrity of, or the maintenance of public confidence in, the
game of basketball, and (ii) a fine and/or suspension that results in
a financial impact to the player of more than \$25,000, the Griev-
ance Arbitrator shall apply an "arbitrary and capricious" standard
of review.
Section 6.     Grievance Arbitrator.
         The parties to this Agreement shall agree upon the appoint-
ment of a new Grievance Arbitrator, who shall serve for the dura-
tion of this Agreement; provided, however, that as of Septem-
ber 1, 1997, and as of each successive September 1, either of the
parties to this Agreement may discharge the Grievance Arbitrator
by serving thirty (30) days' prior written notice upon him and upon
the other party to this Agreement. The parties shall thereupon ei-
ther agree upon a successor Grievance Arbitrator or select a suc-
cessor from an American Arbitration Association list of prominent
professional arbitrators, alternately striking names from such list
until only one remains. The Grievance Arbitrator so discharged
shall continue to serve until his successor is agreed upon or se-
lected.
Section 7.     Injury Grievances.
         (a) Disputes arising under paragraphs 7, 16(b), or 16(c) of
a Uniform Player Contract as to (i) whether a player was in suffi-
ciently good condition to play skilled basketball, (ii) whether the
player was injured as a direct result of participating in any basket-
ball practice or game played for the Team, and/or (iii) whether such
injury disabled the player and/or rendered him unfit to play skilled
basketball, shall be processed and determined in the same manner
as a Grievance under Sections 2-6 of this Article XXXI, except that
if a party to such Grievance so elects, a physician designated by
the President of the American College of Orthopedic Surgeons (or
such other similar organization as the parties agree may be mostappropriate to the issues in dispute) and who has no relationship
    with any party covered by this Agreement shall conduct a physical
    examination of the player and shall perform the functions of the
    Grievance Arbitrator. The physician so designated shall render a
    written decision which shall constitute full, final and complete dis-
    position of the dispute, and shall be binding upon the player(s) and
    Team(s) involved and the parties to this Agreement. Any fees or
    costs associated with the physician's determination will be borne
    equally by both sides.
             (b) All other disputes arising under paragraphs 7, 16(b),
    or 16(c) of a Uniform Player Contract (including, but not limited
    to, a dispute as to whether the suspension of a player or the termi-
    nation of a Player Contract was by reason of a disability resulting
    from a re-injury to or aggravation of a previous injury or preexist-
    ing condition) shall not be subject to the special procedure set forth 1 I
    in Section 7(a) above, but rather shall be processed and determined
    in the same manner as any other Grievance under Sections 2-6 of
    this Article.
    Section 8.       Special Procedures with Respect to Player
                     Discipline.
             (a) Any dispute involving (i) a fine or suspension imposed
    upon a player by the Commissioner (or his designee) for conduct
    on the playing court, or (ii) action taken by the Commissioner (or
    his designee) concerning the preservation of the integrity of, or the
    maintenance of public confidence in, the game of basketball re-
    sulting in a financial impact to the player of \$25,000 or less, shall
    be processed exclusively as follows:
                  (i) Within twenty (20) days following written notifica-
         tion of the action taken by the Commissioner (or his designee),
         a player affected thereby or the Players Association may ap-
         peal in writing to the Commissioner.(ii) The Commissioner shall designate a time and place
     for hearing, which shall be commenced within 10 days follow-
     ing his receipt of the notice of appeal.
              (iii) As soon as practicable following the conclusion
     of such hearing, the Commissioner shall render a written deci-
     sion, which decision shall constitute full, final and complete
     disposition of the dispute, and shall be binding upon the
     Player(s) and Club(s) involved and the parties to this Agree-
     ment.
              (iv) In the event such appeal involves a fine or suspen-
     sion imposed by the Commissioner's designee, the Commis-
     sioner, as a consequence of such appeal and hearing, shall have
     authority only to affirm or reduce such fine or suspension, and
     shall not have authority to increase such fine or suspension.
         (b) In the event a matter filed as a Grievance in accordance
with the provisions of Section 2(d) gives rise to issues involving
the integrity of, or public confidence in, the game of basketball,
and the financial impact to the player of the action being grieved is
\$25,000 or less, the Commissioner may, at any stage of its process-
ing, order that the matter be withdrawn from such processing and
thereafter be processed in accordance with the procedure provided
in Section 8(a).
Section 9.       Escrow Procedure.
         In the event that a Grievance challenging a Commissioner
or Team-imposed fine and/or suspension is filed in accordance with
this Article, the amount of any fine or salary lost by virtue of the
suspension shall be deposited with an Escrow Agent selected by
the NBA and subsequently disbursed in accordance with the provi-
sions of the NBA-NBPA Grievance Escrow Agreement, which is
attached and made part of this Agreement as Exhibit F.Section 10. Disputes with Respect to the Terms of a
                    Player Contract.
             (a) If either the NBA or the Players Association asserts that
    a term or provision of a Player Contract is not permitted by this
    Agreement, either may have the dispute involving such Contract
    term or provision resolved by initiating a Grievance. If such a Griev-
    ance is initiated by the NBA, the 20-day time period referred to in
    Section 2( c) of this Article XXXI shall commence with the date
    upon which the NBA received the Player Contract (or amendment
    thereto) containing the disputed term or provision. If such a Griev-
    ance is initiated by the Players Association, the 20-day time period
    referred to in Section 2( c) of this Article XXXI shall commence
    with the date upon which the Player Contract (or amendment
    thereto) containing the disputed term or provision was first made
    available for inspection by the Players Association.
             (b) If, as a result of the Grievance and Arbitration proce-
    dure, a Player Contract is found to contain a term or provision that
    is not permitted by this Agreement, then (i) such term or provision
    shall be deleted from the Player Contract and have no force or ef-
    fect, and the Player Contract shall in all other respects remain valid
    and binding upon the parties thereto, and (ii) if the Team and the
    Player agree to reform or revise the Player Contract within 30 days
    of the Grievance Arbitrator's decision, such reformation or revi-
    sion shall be exempted from the rules governing Renegotiations
    contained in Article VII, Section 7(c).
             (c) Nothing set forth above shall affect in any manner the
    Commissioner's authority with respect to the approval or disap-
    proval of Player Contracts pursuant to paragraph 11 of the Uni-
    form Player Contract; and the fact that the Commissioner has ap-
    proved or not disapproved a Player Contract containing a term or
    provision not permitted by this Agreement shall not be referred to
    in the course of the Grievance and Arbitration procedure and shall
    not be considered in any manner or for any purpose by the Griev-
                                                                           - j171
ance Arbitrator in connection with a dispute concerning that Player
Contract.
Section 11.      Disputes with Respect to Players Under Contract
                 Who Withhold Playing Services.
         In addition to any other rights a Member may have under
contract or law, including those under paragraph 9 of a Uniform
Player Contract, a Member may recover damages in a proceeding
before the Grievance Arbitrator when a player who is party to a
currently effective Player Contract fails or refuses to render the
services called for under the Player Contract. In any such proceed-
ing, where the Grievance Arbitrator determines that damages are
continuing to accrue at the time of the hearing, the Arbitrator shall
award such damages (if any) as the Member has by then sustained,
and the hearing shall remain open to enable the submission of proof
on the issue of continuing damages.
Section 12.     Expedited Procedure.
         (a) Subject to Article XXXII, Section 1, notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event of a dispute arising under Article XVII,
Article XXX, or Article XXXI, Section 11 of this Agreement, or
under paragraph 15 of a Uniform Player Contract (but only insofar
as such paragraph provides), or in the event of an alleged breach by
a player of paragraph 9 of a Uniform Player Contract, the NBA, or
the Players Association, or a Team may request that such dispute
or alleged breach be referred immediately to the Grievance Arbi-
trator. In any such case, the dispute or alleged breach shall be as-
serted by notice in writing or by facsimile given to the other party
or parties, the NBA, and the Grievance Arbitrator.
         (b) In addition, any disputes or questions that under
Articles VII, X, and XI are to be arbitrated pursuant to the Expe-
dited Procedure shall, except with respect to notice, be arbitrated
in the manner set forth in this Section 12.(c) The Grievance Arbitrator shall convene a hearing with
    respect to such dispute or alleged breach at the earliest possible
    time, but in no event later than 24 hours following his receipt of
    such notice. If the Grievance Arbitrator is not immediately avail-
    able and the parties are unable to agree upon another grievance
    arbitrator, the American Arbitration Association shall appoint such
    other grievance arbitrator.
             (d) The award, which shall be issued not later than 24 hours
    after the conclusion of the hearing, shall be in writing and may be
    issued with or without opinion. If any party desires an opinion,
    one shall be issued but its issuance shall not delay compliance with
    the enforcement of the award. The award shall constitute full, fi-
    nal and complete disposition of the dispute or alleged breach, and
    shall be binding upon the player(s) and Team(s) involved and the
    parties to this Agreement.
             (e) The failure of any party to attend the hearing as sched-
    uled shall not delay the hearing, and the Grievance Arbitrator is
    authorized to proceed to take evidence and issue an award as though
    such party were present.
    Section 13.     Threshold Amounts for Certain Grievances.
             A fine or suspension imposed by a Team shall be appeal-
    able to the Grievance Arbitrator only if it results in a financial im-
    pact on the player of more than \$2,000. A fine or suspension im-
    posed by the Commissioner shall be appealable to the Grievance
    Arbitrator only if it results in a financial impact on the player of
    more than \$10,000.
    Section 14.     Miscellaneous.
             (a) Each of the time limits set forth herein may be extended
    by mutual agreement of the parties involved.
             (b) In any meeting or hearing provided for herein, a player
    may be accompanied by a representative of the Players Associa-tion who may participate in such meeting or hearing and represent
    the player. In any such meeting or hearing, the NBA and any other
    party may attend and be accompanied by a representative who may
    participate in such meeting or hearing and represent the NBA and
    any such party.
             (c) The parties recognize that a player may be subjected to
    disciplinary action for just cause by his Team or by the Commis-
    sioner (or his designee). Therefore, in Grievances regarding disci-
    pline, the issue to be resolved shall be whether there has been just
    cause for the penalty imposed.
             (d) Nothing contained herein shall excuse a player from
    prompt compliance with any discipline imposed upon him. If dis-
    cipline imposed upon a player is determined to be improper by a
    final disposition under this Article XXXI, the player shall promptly
    be made whole.
             (e) Nothing contained in this Article XXXI shall be deemed
    to limit or impair the right of the NBA or any Team to impose
    discipline upon a player(s) or to take any other action not inconsis-
    tent with the provisions of a Player Contract or this Agreement.
             (f) Subject to Section 3(c) above, all costs of arbitration,
    including the fees and expenses of the Grievance Arbitrator, shall
    be borne equally by the parties thereto; but each party shall bear
    the cost of its own witnesses, counsel, and the like.
             (g) A Team shall not be required to terminate a Player
    Contract under the NBA waiver procedure as a condition precedent
    to the filing of a Grievance with respect to such Player Contract.

    To the extent that the decision of the Impartial Arbitrator in In re
    Otis Birdsong, Dec. No. 87-2, May 14, 1987, is inconsistent with
    the foregoing, it is hereby overruled.
             (h) In a proceeding involving the interpretation of a Player
    Contract, no Player Contract other than the Player Contract that is
    the subject of dispute shall be admissible in evidence.
