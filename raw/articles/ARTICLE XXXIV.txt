    sistent with the Internal Revenue Code (or the rules and regula-
    tions issued thereunder), the National Labor Relations Act, any other
    federal, state, provincial, or local statute or ordinance, or the rules

    exemption retaining, to the extent possible, the intention of such
    provision.
