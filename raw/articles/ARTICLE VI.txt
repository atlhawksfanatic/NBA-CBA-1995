ARTICLE VI
                          PLAYER CONDUCT
   Section 1.    Fines and Suspensions.
            In addition to any other rights a Team may have by Con-
   tract (including but not limited to the rights set forth in paragraph
   9 of the Uniform Player Contract) or by law, when a player, with-
   out proper and reasonable cause, fails or refuses to render the ser-
   vices required by a Player Contract and/or when a player is, for
   proper cause, suspended by his Team or the NBA in accordance
   with the terms of such Contract, the Salary payable to the player
   for the year of the Contract during which such refusal or failure
   and/or suspension occurs may be reduced (or, in the case of a sus-
   pension, shall be reduced) as follows:
            (a) By \$1,000 for each missed (training or Regular Sea-
   son) day of practice (for the first two such missed practices), and
   by \$2,500 for each missed practice thereafter;
            (b) By \$4,000 for each missed Exhibition Game;
            (c) By 1/82nd of the player's Current Cash Compensation
   for each missed Regular Season or Playoff game;
            (d) By \$1,000 for each missed promotional appearance
   required in accordance with Article II, Section 7(b) and para-
                                                                         1_
   graph 13 of the Uniform Player Contract;
            (e) By \$10,000 for failing to attend the Rookie Transition
   Program; and
            (f) By \$5,000 for failing to attend any other programs des-
   ignated as mandatory by either the NBA or the Players Association
   (e.g., HIV and substance abuse education programs), the designa-
   tion of which by either party shall be subject to approval by the
   other, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.39
Section 2.     Charitable Contributions.
         If, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, (a) any fine or
suspension is imposed on a player, (b) such fine or suspension-
related salary amount is paid to the League, and (c) the fine or
suspension is not grieved by the player under the provisions of
Article XXXI, then, beginning with the 1996-97 Season, the NBA
shall remit fifty percent (50\%) of the Salary withheld (or payment
received) as a result of the fine or suspension to the National
Basketball Players Association Foundation (the "NBPA Founda-
tion") or such other charitable organization selected by the Players
Association that qualifies for treatment under Section 501(c)(3) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as now in effect or as it
may hereafter be amended (a "Section 501(c)(3) Organization"),
and that is approved by the NBA (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld) (both hereinafter, the "NBPA-Selected
Charitable Organization"). The NBA shall remit the remaining
fifty percent (50\%) of the withheld Salary to a Section 501(c)(3)
organization selected by the NBA and approved by the Players As-
sociation, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. If
the player files a timely Grievance under Article XXXI, the Salary
withheld (or the payment received), including fifty percent (50\%)
of any accrued interest, shall be contributed to charity in the man-
ner set forth above only to the extent the player does not prevail in
the Grievance. The remittances made by the NBA pursuant to this
Section shall be made annually, fifteen (15) days following the end
of the NBA Season during which the fine or suspension-related
salary amount is received. For purposes of this Article and all other
provisions of this Agreement, any money remitted or paid to the
National Basketball Players Association Foundation by the NBA
shall be used for charitable purposes only, and not, for example,
for any salaries of Foundation employees or administrative ex-
penses.
