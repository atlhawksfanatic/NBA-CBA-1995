ARTICLE XXXIII
                      RECOGNITION CLAUSE
        The NBA recognizes the Players Association as the exclu-
sive collective bargaining representative of persons who are em-
ployed by NBA Members as professional basketball players (and/
or who may become so employed during the term of this Agree-
ment or any extension thereof); and the Players Association war-
rants that it is duly empowered to enter into this Agreement for and
on behalf of such persons. The NBA and the Players Association
agree that, notwithstanding the foregoing, such persons and NBA
Members may, on an individual basis, bargain with respect to and
agree upon the provisions of Player Contracts, but only as and to
the extent permitted by this Agreement.
