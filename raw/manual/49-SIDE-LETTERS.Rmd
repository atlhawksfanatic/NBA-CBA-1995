Dear Alex:
     This will confirm our agreement that a team's termination of a
Uniform Player Contract by reason of the player's "lack of skill" (under
paragraph 16(a)(ii) of the UPC) shall be interpreted to include a
termination based on the team's determination that, in view ofthe player's
level of skill (in the sole opinion of the Team), the salary paid (or to be
paid) to the player is no longer commensurate with the team's financial
plans or needs. This agreement shall not affect any post-termination
obligation to pay salary that may result from salary protection provisions
included in a Uniform Player Contract.
     Ifthe foregoing coincides with your understanding of our agreement,
