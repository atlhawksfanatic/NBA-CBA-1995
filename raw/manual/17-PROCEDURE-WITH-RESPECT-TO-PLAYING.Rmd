ARTICLE XVII
         PROCEDURE WITH RESPECT TO PLAYING
            CONDITIONS AT VARIOUS FACILITIES
         When a new franchise is granted or when an existing fran-
chise moves to another city, the Players Association shall, upon
request and within a reasonable period of time, have the right to
inspect the facility to be used by such franchise. Similarly, the
Players Association shall, upon reasonable notice to the Team(s)
involved and the NBA, have the right to inspect the training camp
and practice facilities used by such Team(s). If, following such
inspection, the Players Association is of the opinion that the play-
ing conditions at such facility will endanger the health and safety
of NBA players, it shall promptly notify the Commissioner in writ-
ing. Promptly following such notice, representatives of the Play-
ersAssociation and oftheTeam(s) involved, and the Commissioner
or his designee shall meet in an effort to resolve the matter. It is
agreed that the failure of the parties to resolve the matter shall not
impair the legally binding effect of this Agreement or create any
right to (a) unilaterally implement during the term of this Agree-
ment any provision concerning such unresolved matter, (b) lock
out, or (c) strike. If no resolution satisfactory to the Players Asso-
ciation, the Team(s) involved and the Commissioner is reached,
the issue whether the playing conditions at the facility in question
will endanger the health and safety of NBA players will, without
interruption of the schedule or training game or practice activities,
immediately be submitted to and determined by the Grievance Ar-
bitrator in accordance with the provisions of Article XXXI; pro-
vided, however, that the Grievance Arbitrator need not render an
award within 24 hours of the conclusion of the hearing, but shall
issue his award as expeditiously as possible under the circumstances.
