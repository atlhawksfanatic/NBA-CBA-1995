                    (A) Prior to the issuance of the Audit Report for
       the prior Season, the Minimum Annual Salary shall be the Mini-
       mum Annual Salary for the prior Season increased by ten per-
       cent (10\%).
                    (B) Following the issuance of the Audit Report for
       the prior Season, the MinimumAnnual Salary shall be the Mini-
       mum Annual Salary for the prior Season increased by the greater
       of ten percent (10\%) or the percentage by which BRI for the
       prior Season increased over BRI for the Season immediatelypreceding such prior Season. Once the Audit Report for the
             prior Season is issued, any Player Contract that provides for
             the Minimum Annual Salary calculated pursuant to subsection
             (A) above shall be deemed amended to provide for the Mini-
             mum Annual Salary calculated pursuant to this subsection (B).

        Minimum Annual Salary requirements established by this Section,

        ant to Article VII, Section 3(b », and other bonuses not contingent
        upon a player's or a Team's attaining a particular level of perfor-
        mance shall be considered as part of the Salary provided for by a
        Player Contract, provided that such Player Contract makes clear
        that the Salary for each Season (including bonuses) equals or ex-
        ceeds the Minimum Annual Salary for such Season.
                 (d) Nothing in this Section shall alter the respective rights
        and liabilities of a player and a Team, as provided for in the Uni-
        form Player Contract or in this Agreement, with respect to the ter-
        mination of a Player Contract.

        is in any way identified with the Team) on behalf of an entity or
        person that offers a product or service that competes in the same
.......
        product or service category as the products or services of a Pro-

             sors of the Team that it seeks to protect against conflicting com-
             mercial or promotional activities in the Team's local marketingarea involving thatTeam's players ("Protected Team Sponsors").

                 (ii) If a Team chooses to designate Protected Team
        Sponsor(s), the Team must notify its players of such designa-
        tion, and of the product or service categories in which its Pro-
        tected Team Sponsor(s) compete, on or before the September 1
        immediately preceding the year in which the Protected Team
        Sponsor designation will apply.
                 (iii) A Team may not designate a sponsor as a Protected  -~
        Team Sponsor unless the sponsor conducts business in a prod-
        uct or service category set forth in Exhibit E to this Agreement.

        be designated as Protected Team Sponsors. Nothing in this
        Section 7(a) shall prohibit a player from entering into a con-
        tract or other commercial arrangement to perform national pro-
        motional activities on behalf of an entity or person that con-
        ducts business on a nationwide basis.
             (b) A player's obligation (pursuant to paragraph 13(e) of a

   by such Contract, the Player makes six individual personal appear-
   ances and six group appearances for or on behalf of or at the re-
   quest of the Team (or Team Affiliate) by which he is employed
   and/or the NBA. Up to two of these twelve appearances may be
   assigned by the Team and/or the NBA in any year to NBA Proper-
   ties. The Player shall be reimbursed for the actual expenses in-
   curred in connection with any such appearance, provided that such
   expenses result directly from the appearance and are ordinary and
   reasonable. The Player shall also receive compensation from
   the Team by which he is employed of at least \$1,000, in accor-
   dance with paragraph 13(e) of the Uniform Player Contract, for         "
   each promotional appearance he makes for a commercial sponsor
                                                                            :.

            (i) take place during (A) the period from the first day
    of a Season through the day of the NBA Draft following such
    Season, or (B) during the off-season, provided that no player
    may be required to make more than one off-season appearance
    in any year covered by his Contract and no player may be re-
    quired to make such an off-season appearance unless he re-
    sides in or is otherwise located in the area where the appear-
    ance is to take place;

    player has traveled to play in a scheduled NBA game;
            (iii) not occur at a time that would interfere with a

ited to ten (10) days or a period encompassing three (3) games

   the course of anyone Season.
            (b) The Salary payable pursuant to a lO-Day Contract shall
   not be less than an amount calculated by multiplying the Minimum
   Annual Salary (as set forth in Article II, Sections 6(a) and (b)) for
   the NBA Season in which such Contract is executed by a fraction,
   the numerator of which is the number of days spent by such player
   in the service of such Team and the denominator of which is the
   total number of days of that NBA Regular Season.

   ecuted by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
   remaining in the NBA Regular Season and the denominator of which

        or an amendment thereto as soon as practicable. Immediately
        upon the consummation of any such agreement, the Team shall
                                                                              i
                                                                         "_ .Dnotify the NBA by facsimile or e-lJlail and provide the NBA

    ment concerning terms and conditions of employment is bind-
    ing upon the Player or the Team until a Player Contract em-
    bodying such terms aqd conditions has been duly executed by
    the parties. Nothing herein is intended to affect (A) any au-
    thority of the Commissioner to approve or disapprove Player
