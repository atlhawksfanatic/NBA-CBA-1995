             PROHIBITION OF NO-TRADE CONTRACTS
    Section 1.      General Limitation.
             No Player Contract may contain any prohibition or limita-
    tion of an NBA Team's right to assign such Contract to another
    NBA Team.
    Section 2.      Exceptions to General Limitation.
             Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1 of this Ar-
    ticle XXIV:
             (a) A Player Contract may contain (in Exhibit 4 to such
    Player Contract) a provision entitling a Player to receive, on a one-
    time basis, upon the first assignment of that Player Contract, a sum
    of money that does not exceed, or property or investments with a
    fair market value that does not exceed, 15\% of the compensation
    remaining to be earned by the Player pursuant to that Player Con-
    tract at the time of such first assignment.
              (b) A Player Contract entered into by a player who has eight
    (8) or more years of service in the NBA and who has rendered four
    (4) or more years of service for the Team entering into such Con-
    tract may contain a prohibition or limitation of such Team's right to
    assign such contract to another NBA Team. For the purposes of
    this Section 2(b), a player shall be credited with one year of NBA
    service for each NBA Season for which he is signed to play, whether
    or not his services are retained by that NBA Team for the start, or for
    any portion, of the Season for which he is signed; provided, how-
    ever, that if a player signs a Player Contract with a stated term of
    more than one Season, he shall receive credit for the first Season of
    such Contract, and thereafter will receive credit only for such Sea-
    sons in which his services are retained for any portion of such Sea-
    son (including regular training camp). Notwithstanding the above,
    a player will not receive credit for a year of service for an NBA
                                                                            .~   j149
Season in which he: (i) withholds playing services called for by a
Player Contract for more than thirty days after the NBA Season be-
gins; or (ii) is signed only to one or more lO-day Player Contracts
with more than 10 days remaining in that NBA season.
