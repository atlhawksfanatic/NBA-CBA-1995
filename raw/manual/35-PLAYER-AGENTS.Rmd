ARTICLE XXXV
                         PLAYER AGENTS
Section 1.     Approval of Player Contracts.
         The NBA shall not approve any Player Contract between a
player and a Team unless such player: (i) is represented in the ne-
gotiations with respect to such Player Contract by an agent or rep-
resentative duly certified by the Players Association in accordance
with the Players Association's Agent Regulation Program and au-
thorized to represent him; or (ii) acts on his own behalf in negotiat-
ing such Player Contract.
Section 2.     Fines.
         The NBA shall impose a fine of \$10,000 upon any Team
that negotiates a Player Contract with an agent or representative
not certified by the Players Association in accordance with the Play-
ers Association's Agent Regulation Program if, at the time of such
negotiations, such Team either (i) knows that such agent or repre-
sentative has not been so certified or (ii) fails to make reasonable
inquiry of the NBA as to whether such agent or representative has
been so certified. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in no
event shall any Team be subject to a fine if the Team negotiates a
Player Contract with the agent designated as the player's autho-
rized agent on the then-current agent list provided by the Players
Association to the NBA in accordance with Section 4 below.
Section 3.     Indemnity.
         The Players Association agrees to indemnify and hold harm-
less the NBA and each of its Teams and their successors, agents,
attorneys, heirs and executors from any and all claims of any kind
arising from or relating to (i) the Players Association 's Agent Regu-
lation Program, and (ii) the provisions of this Article, including,
without limitation, any judgments, costs and settlements, providedthat the Players Association is immediately notified of such claim
    in writing (and, in no event later than five days from the receipt
    thereof), is given the opportunity to assume the defense thereof,
    and the NBA and/or its Teams (whichever is sued) use their best
    efforts to defend such claim, and do not admit liability with re-
    spect to and do not settle such claim without the prior written con-
    sent of the Players Association.
    Section 4.     Agent Lists.
             The Players Association agrees to provide the NBA League
    Office with a list of (i) all agents certified under the Players
    Association's Agent Regulation Program, and (ii) the players rep-
    resented by each such agent. Such list shall be updated once every
    two weeks from the day after the NBA Finals to the first day of the
    next succeeding Regular Season and shall be updated once every
    month at all other times.
    Section 5.      Confirmation by the Players Association.
             If the NBA has reason to believe that the agent represent-
    ing a player in Contract negotiations is not a certified agent or is
    not the agent authorized to represent the player, the NBA may, at
    its election, request in writing from the Players Association confir-
    mation as to whether the agent that represented the player in the
    Contract negotiations is in fact the player's certified representa-
    tive. If within three business days of the date the Players Associa-
    tion receives such written request, the NBA does not receive a writ-
    ten response from the Players Association stating that the agent
    that represented the player is not the player's certified representa-
    tive, then the NBA shall be free to act as if the agent was certified.
                                                                           L _,~
