ARTICLE XXV
          LIMITATION ON DEFERRED COMPENSATION
    Section 1.     General Limitation.
            No NBA Team may sign a Player Contract with any player
    under which more than 30\% of Salary is Deferred Compensation.
    For purposes of this provision only, Deferred Compensation shall
    mean Deferred Compensation during the period commencing more
    than two years after the playing term covered by a Player Contract.
    Section 2.    Attribution.
            All Player Contracts shall specify the Season(s) to which
    any Deferred Compensation is attributable.
    Section 3.    Rabbi Trusts.
            (a) Notwithstanding Section 1, a Player Contract may pro-
    vide for an annuity to be purchased by the Team that will pay the
    Player (or his designees) an amount of Deferred Compensation in
    excess of 30\% of Salary, provided that:
                (i) The Team and the Player agree with respect to the
        form and terms of the annuity instrument and the institution
        from which it is purchased;
                (ii) Ownership of the annuity and all related aspects
        are structured in a manner that qualifies the arrangement as a
        tax deferred ("rabbi") trust, in the opinion of the NBA's tax
        advisor; and
                (iii) The total cost of the annuity and the schedule of
        payment of such costs are specified in the Player Contract.
            (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in   -J
    subsection (a) above:(i) If the institution obligated to make payment under
the annuity fails to do so for any reason (other than non-com-
pliance by the Team with the provisions of the annuity con-
tract), the Team shall thereupon become obligated to pay to the
Player as Deferred Compensation an 'amount, if any, equal to
the unpaid portion of the purchase price of the annuity for which
the Team remains obligated; and                 '
         (ii) If the creditors of the Team and not the Player re-
ceive payments under the annuity, the Team shall thereupon
become obligated to pay to the Player as Deferred Compensa-
tion an ambunt equal to the full purchase price of the annuity.-,    '~

    Section 1.     Standard Team Rules.
            Subject to Section 2 below, each Team may require its play-
    ers to abide by the rules set forth in the "Standard Club Rules"
    annexed as Exhibit G to the 1988 NBA/NBPA Collective Bargain-
    ing Agreement. Until the NBA and the Players Association agree
    on a set of Uniform Team Rules, the NBA and the Players Associa-
    tion agree that such Standard Club Rules constitute "reasonable
    rules" within the meaning of paragraph 5 of a Uniform Player Con-
    tract.
    Section 2.     Uniform Team Rules.
             (a) The parties agree that, within 90 days from the execu-
    tion of this Agreement, they will negotiate for the purpose of es-
    tablishing a set of Uniform Team Rules that will apply to all Teams,
    except as provided below.
             (b) Any Team may establish a rule or rules supplementing
    the Uniform Team Rules with respect to matters not covered by the
    Uniform Team Rules, provided such supplemental rule(s) are in
    writing and are made available for review by the Players Associa-
    tion no later than the July 31st preceding the training camp period
    during which they are to become effective. If no timely Grievance
    objecting to any such supplemental rule(s) is filed by the Players
    Association with the NBA and the Team establishing such rule(s),
    such rule(s) shall be deemed to constitute "reasonable rules" within
    the meaning of paragraph 5 of a Uniform Player Contract. If a
    timely Grievance with respect to any such supplemental rule(s) is
    filed by the Players Association, such rule(s) shall not become ef-
    fective unless and until they are found to constitute reasonable
                                                                           __ ..d
    rule(s) by the Grievance Arbitrator.(c) If a Team seeks to establish a rule or rules that deviate
from (rather than supplement) the Uniform 'Team Rules, it must
make such non-conforming rule(s) available for review by the Play-
ers Association no later than the July 31 st preceding the training
camp period during which such rule(s) are to become effective. If
no timely Grievance objecting to such non-conforming rule(s) is
filed by the Players Association with the NBA and the Team estab-
lishing such rule(s), such rule(s) shall be deemed to constitute "rea-
sonable rules" within the meaning of paragraph 5 of a Uniform
Player Contract. If a timely Grievance with respect to such non-
conforming rule(s) is filed by the Players Association, such rule(s)
shall not become effective unless and until they are found to con-
stitute reasonable rule(s) by the Grievance Arbitrator. In any such
Grievance, the Team shall have the burden of establishing that its
non-conforming rule(s) are reasonable and justified by particular
circumstances warranting a departure from the Uniform Team Rules.
