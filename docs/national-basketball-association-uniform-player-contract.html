<p>THIS AGREEMENT made this ___ day of ________ 19 _ by and between (hereinafter called the “Team”), a member of the National Basketball Association (hereinafter called the “NBA” or “League”) and ___________ whose address is shown below (hereinafter called the “Player”).</p>
<center>
WITNESSETH:
</center>
<p>In consideration of the mutual promises hereinafter contained, the parties hereto promise and agree as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>TERM.</strong> The Team hereby employs the Player as a skilled basketball player for a term of __ year(s) from the 1st day of September 19 __.</li>
<li><strong>SERVICES.</strong>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>The services to be rendered by the Player pursuant to this Contract shall include: (i) attendance at any training camp, (ii) attendance at any practices and meetings conducted by the Team during any Regular Season or Playoffs, (iii) playing the games scheduled for the Team during any Regular Season, (iv) playing all Exhibition games scheduled by the Team or the League during and prior to any Regular Season, (v) playing (if invited to participate) in any of the NBA’s All-Star Games (including the Rookie Game) and attending every event conducted in association with such All-Star Games (including, but not limited to, a reasonable number of media sessions and any event that is part of an All-Star Skills Competition if the Player had previously agreed to participate in that Competition), (vi) playing the Playoff games subsequent to) any Regular Season, and (vii) participating in promotional activities of the Team and the League as set forth in paragraph 13 herein.</li>
<li>If the Player is a Veteran, the Player will not be required to attend training camp earlier than 4 p.m. (local time) on the twenty-ninth day prior to the first game of any Regular Season. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Team is scheduled during a particular NBA Season to participate outside of the United States or Canada in a Pre-Season Exhibition game or a Regular Season game during the first week of the Regular Season, such Veteran Player may be required to attend the training camp conducted in advance of that Regular Season by 4 p.m. (local time) on the thirty-second day prior to the first game of the Regular Season. Rookies may be required to attend training camp at an earlier date, but no earlier than ten (10) days prior to the date that Veterans are required to attend.</li>
<li>Exhibition games shall not be played on the three (3) days prior to the opening of the Team’s Regular Season schedule, nor on the day prior to a Regular Season game, nor on the day prior to and the day following the All-Star Game. Exhibition games prior to any Regular Season shall not exceed eight (including intra-squad games for which admission is charged), and Exhibition games during any Regular Season shall not exceed three.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>COMPENSATION.</strong>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Subject to paragraph 3(b) below, the Team agrees to pay the Player for rendering the services described herein the compensation described in Exhibit 1 hereto (less all amounts required to be withheld by federal, state, and local authorities, and exclusive of any amount(s) which the Player shall be entitled to receive from the Player Playoff Pool). Unless otherwise provided in Exhibit 1, such compensation shall be paid in twelve (12) equal semi-monthly payments beginning with the first of said payments on November 15th of each year covered by the Contract and continuing with such payments on the first and fifteenth of each month until said compensation is paid in full; provided, however, if the Team does not qualify for the Playoffs, the payments for the year involved which would otherwise be due subsequent to the conclusion of the Regular Season shall become due and payable immediately after the conclusion of the Regular Season.</li>
<li>The Team agrees to pay the Player $1,200 per week, pro rata, less all amounts required to be withheld by federal, state, and local authorities, for each week (up to a maximum of four (4) weeks for veterans and up to a maximum of five (5) weeks for Rookies) prior to the Team’s first Regular Season game that the Player is in attendance at training camp or Exhibition games; provided, however, that no such payments shall be made if, prior to the date on which he is required to attend training camp, the Player has been paid $10,000 or more in compensation with respect to the NBA Season scheduled to commence immediately following such training camp. Any compensation paid by the Team pursuant to this subparagraph shall be considered an advance against any compensation owed to the Player pursuant to paragraph 3(a) above, and the first scheduled payment of such compensation (or such subsequent payments, if the first scheduled payment is not sufficient) shall be reduced by the amount of such advance.</li>
<li>The Team will not pay and the Player will not accept any bonus or anything of value on account of the Team’s winning any particular NBA game or series of games or attaining a certain position in the standings of the League as of a certain date, other than the final standing of the Team.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>EXPENSES.</strong> The Team agrees to pay all proper and necessary expenses of the Player, including the reasonable board and lodging expenses of the Player while playing for the Team “on the road” and during the training camp period (but only until the Team breaks training camp) for as long as the Player is not then living at home. The Player, while “on the road” (and during the training camp period, only if the Team does not pay for meals directly), shall be paid a meal expense allowance as set forth in the Collective Bargaining Agreement currently in effect between the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association (hereinafter “the NBA/NBPA Collective Bargaining Agreement”). No deductions from such meal expense allowance shall be made for meals served on an airplane. During the training camp period (and if the Team does not pay for meals directly), the meal expense allowance shall be paid in weekly installments commencing with the first week of training camp. For the purposes of this paragraph, the Player shall be considered to be “on the road” from the time the Team leaves its home city until the time the Team arrives back at its home city.</li>
<li><strong>CONDUCT.</strong>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>The Player agrees to observe and comply with all Team rules, as maintained or promulgated in accordance with the NBA/NBPA Collective Bargaining Agreement, at all times whether on or off the playing floor. Subject to the provisions of the NBA/NBPA Collective Bargaining Agreement, such rules shall be part of this Contract as fully as if herein written and shall be binding upon the Player.</li>
<li>The Player agrees (i) to give his best services, as well as his loyalty, to the Team, and to play basketball only for the Team and its assignees; (ii) to be neatly and fully attired in public; (iii) to conduct himself on and off the court according to the highest standards of honesty, citizenship, and sportsmanship; and (iv) not to do anything that is materially detrimental or materially prejudicial to the best interests of the Team or of the League.</li>
<li>For any violation of Team rules, any breach of any provision of this Contract, or for any conduct impairing the faithful and thorough discharge of the duties incumbent upon the Player, the Team may reasonably impose fines and/or suspensions on the Player in accordance with the terms of the NBA/NBPA Collective Bargaining Agreement.</li>
<li>The Player acknowledges that he has read and is familiar with Article 35 of the NBA Constitution, a copy of which, as in effect on the date of this Contract, is attached hereto. Such Article provides that the Commissioner is empowered to impose fines upon and/or suspend the Player for causes and in the manner provided in such Article.</li>
<li>The Player agrees that if the Commissioner, in his sole judgment, shall find that the Player has bet, or has offered or attempted to bet, money or anything of value on the outcome of any game participated in by any team which is a member of the NBA, the Commissioner shall have the power in his sole discretion to suspend the Player indefinitely or to expel him as a player for any member of the NBA, and the Commissioner’s finding and decision shall be final, binding, conclusive, and unappealable.</li>
<li>The Player agrees that he will not, during the term of this Contract, directly or indirectly, entice, induce, or persuade, or attempt to entice, induce, or persuade, any player or coach who is under contract to any NBA team to enter into negotiations for or relating to his services as a basketball player or coach, nor shall he negotiate for or contract for such services, except with the prior written consent of such team. Breach of this subparagraph, in addition to the remedies available to the Team, shall be punishable by fine and/or suspension to be imposed by the Commissioner.</li>
<li>When the Player is fined and/or suspended by the Team or the NBA, he shall be given notice in writing (with a copy to the Players Association), stating the amount of the fine or the duration of the suspension and the reasons therefor.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>WITHHOLDING AND ESCROW.</strong>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>In the event the Player is fined and/or suspended by the Team or the NBA pursuant to any provision of paragraph 5 above, the Team shall withhold the amount of the fine or, in the case of a suspension, the amount provided in Article VI of the NBA/NBPA Collective Bargaining Agreement from any Current Cash Compensation due or to become due to the Player with respect to the NBA Season in which the conduct resulting in the fine and/or the suspension occurred (or a subsequent Season if the Player has received all Current Cash Compensation due to him for the then current Season). If, at the time the Player is fined and/or suspended, the Current Cash Compensation remaining to be paid to the Player under this Contract is not sufficient to cover such fine and/or suspension, then the Player agrees promptly to pay the amount directly to the Team. In no case shall the Player permit any such fine and/or suspension to be paid on his behalf by anyone other than himself.</li>
<li>Any Current Cash Compensation withheld from or paid by the Player pursuant to this paragraph 6 shall be retained by the Team or the League, as the case may be, unless the Player contests the fine and/or suspension by initiating a timely Grievance in accordance with the provisions of the NBA/NBPA Collective Bargaining Agreement. If such Grievance is initiated and it satisfies Article XXXI, Section 13 of the NBA/NBPA Collective Bargaining Agreement, the amount withheld from the Player shall be placed in escrow, pursuant to Article XXXI, Section 9 of such Agreement, pending the resolution of the Grievance.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>PHYSICAL CONDITION.</strong>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>The Player agrees to report at the time and place fixed by the Team in good physical condition and to keep himself throughout each NBA Season in good physical condition.</li>
<li>If the Player, in the judgment of the Team’s physician, is not in good physical condition at the date of his first scheduled game for the Team, or if, at the beginning of or during any Season, he fails to remain in good physical condition (unless such condition results directly from an injury sustained by the Player as a direct result of participating in any basketball practice or game played for the Team during such Season), so as to render the Player, in the judgment of the Team’s physician, unfit to play skilled basketball, the Team shall have the right to suspend such Player until such time as, in the judgment of the Team’s physician, the Player is in sufficiently good physical condition to play skilled basketball. In the event of such suspension, the Regular Salary payable to the Player for any Season during such suspension shall be reduced in the same proportion as the length of the period during which, in the judgment of the Team’s physician, the Player is unfit to play skilled basketball, bears to the length of such Season.</li>
<li>If, during the term of this Contract, the Player is injured as a direct result of participating in any basketball practice or game played for the Team, the Team will pay the Player’s reasonable hospitalization and medical expenses (including doctor’s bills), provided that the hospital and doctor are selected by the Team, and provided further that the Team shall be obligated to pay only those expenses incurred as a direct result of medical treatment caused solely by and relating directly to the injury sustained by the Player. Subject to the provisions set forth in Exhibit 3, if in the judgment of the Team’s physician, the Player’s injuries resulted directly from playing for the Team and render him unfit to play skilled basketball, then, so long as such unfitness continues, but in no event after the Player has received his full compensation for the Season in which the injury was sustained, the Team shall pay to the Player the compensation prescribed in Exhibit 1 to this Contract for such Season. The Team’s obligations hereunder shall be reduced by (i) any workers’ compensation benefits, which, to the extent permitted by law, the Player hereby assigns to the Team and (ii) any insurance provided for by the Team whether paid or payable to the Player.</li>
<li>The Player agrees to give to the Team’s coach, trainer, or physician prompt notice of any injury or illness suffered by him that is likely to affect the Player’s ability to render the services required under this Contract, including the time, place, cause, and nature of such injury or illness.</li>
<li>Should the Player suffer an injury or illness as provided in this paragraph 7, he will submit himself to a medical examination and treatment by a physician designated by the Team. Such examination when made at the request of the Team shall be at its expense, unless made necessary by some act or conduct of the Player contrary to the terms of this Contract.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>PROHIBITED SUBSTANCES.</strong> The Player acknowledges that, in the event he is found, in accordance with Section 1 of the NBA/NBPA Anti-Drug Agreement, to have engaged in the use, possession, or distribution of a “Prohibited Substance” as defined therein, it will result in the termination of this Contract and the Player’s immediate dismissal and disqualification from any employment by the NBA and any of its teams. Notwithstanding any terms or provisions of this Contract (including any amendments hereto), in the event of such termination, all obligations of the Team, including obligations to pay compensation, shall cease, except the obligation of the Team to pay the Player’s earned compensation (whether current or deferred) to the date of termination.</li>
<li><strong>UNIQUE SKILLS.</strong> The Player represents and agrees that he has extraordinary and unique skill and ability as a basketball player, that the services to be rendered by him hereunder cannot be replaced or the loss thereof adequately compensated for in money damages, and that any breach by the Player of this Contract will cause irreparable injury to the Team, and to its assignees. Therefore, it is agreed that in the event it is alleged by the Team that the Player is playing, attempting or threatening to play, or negotiating for the purpose of playing, during the term of this Contract, for any other person, firm, corporation, or organization, the Team and its assignees (in addition to any other remedies that may be available to them judicially or by way of arbitration) shall have the right to obtain from any court or arbitrator having jurisdiction such equitable relief as may be appropriate, including a decree enjoining the Player from any further such breach of this Contract, and enjoining the Player from playing basketball for any other person, firm, corporation, or organization during the term of this Contract. The Player agrees that the Team may at any time assign such right to the NBA for the enforcement thereof. In any suit, action, or arbitration proceeding brought to obtain such equitable relief, the Player does hereby waive his right, if any, to trial by jury, and does hereby waive his right, if any, to interpose any counterclaim or set-off for any cause whatever.</li>
<li><strong>ASSIGNMENT.</strong>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>The Team shall have the right to sell, exchange, assign, or transfer this Contract to any other NBA team and the Player agrees to accept such sale, exchange, assignment, or transfer and to faithfully perform and carry out this contract with the same force and effect as if it had been entered into by the Player with the assignee team instead of with the Team. The Player further agrees that, should the Team contemplate the sale, exchange, assignment, or transfer of this Contract to one or more NBA teams, the Team’s physician may furnish to the physicians and officials of such other team or teams all relevant medical information relating to the Player.</li>
<li>In the event that this Contract is sold, exchanged, assigned or transferred to any other NBA team, all reasonable expenses incurred by the Player in moving himself and his family to the home city of the team to which such sale, exchange, assignment or transfer is made, as a result thereof, shall be paid by the assignee team. Such assignee team hereby agrees that its acceptance of the assignment of this Contract constitutes agreement on its part to make such payment.</li>
<li>In the event that this Contract is assigned to another NBA team, the Player (and the Players Association) shall forthwith be notified orally or by a notice in writing, delivered to the Player personally or delivered or mailed to his last known address, and the Player shall report to the assignee team within forty-eight (48) hours after said notice has been received or within such longer time for reporting as may be specified in said notice. If the Player does not report to the team to which this Contract has been assigned within the aforesaid time, or if a proposed assignment is voided as a result of the Player’s failure to report, the Player may be suspended by the assignee team or assignor Team, as the case may be, and he shall lose the sums which would otherwise be payable to him as long as the suspension lasts.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>VALIDITY AND FILING.</strong> This Contract shall be valid and binding upon the Team and the Player immediately upon its execution. The Team agrees to file a copy of this Contract, and/or any amendment(s) thereto, with the Commissioner of the NBA as soon as practicable by facsimile and overnight mail, but in no event may such filing be made more than forty-eight (48) hours after the execution of this Contract and/or amendment(s). If pursuant to the NBA Constitution and By-Laws or the NBA/NBPA Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Commissioner disapproves this Contract (or amendment) within ten (10) days after the receipt thereof in his office by overnight mail, this Contract (or amendment) shall thereupon terminate and be of no further force or effect and the Team and the Player shall thereupon be relieved of their respective rights and liabilities thereunder. If the Commissioner’s disapproval is subsequently overturned in any proceeding brought under the arbitration provisions of the NBA/NBPA Collective Bargaining Agreement (including any appeals), the Contract shall again be valid and binding upon the Team and the Player, and the Commissioner shall be afforded another ten-day period to disapprove the Contract (based on the Team’s Room at the time the Commissioner’s disapproval is overturned) as set forth in the foregoing sentence. The NBA will promptly inform the Players Association if the Commissioner disapproves this Contract.</li>
<li><strong>OTHER ATHLETIC ACTIVITIES.</strong> The Player and the Team acknowledge and agree that (i) the Player’s participation in other sports may impair or destroy his ability and skill as a basketball player, and (ii) the Player’s participation in basketball out of season may result in injury to him.

If neither the Team nor the League shall cause such alleged default or alleged failure to be remedied within five (5) days after receipt of such written notice, the National Basketball Players Association shall, on behalf of the Player, have the right to request that the dispute concerning such alleged default or alleged failure be referred immediately to the Grievance Arbitrator in accordance with the provisions of the NBA/NBPA Collective Bargaining Agreement.

<ol start="35" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The provisions of this Article 35 shall govern all Players in the Association, hereinafter referred to as “Players.”
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Each Member shall provide and require in every contract with any of its Players that they shall be bound and governed by the provisions of this Article. Each Member, at the direction of the Board of Governors or the Commissioner, as the case may be, shall take such action as the Board or the Commissioner may direct in order to effectuate the purposes of this Article.</li>
<li>The Commissioner shall direct the dismissal and perpetual disqualification from any further association with the Association or any of its Members, of any Player found by the Commissioner after a hearing to have been guilty of offering, agreeing, conspiring, aiding or attempting to cause any game of basketball to result otherwise than on its merits.</li>
<li>Any Player who gives, makes, issues, authorizes or endorses any statement having, or designed to have, an effect prejudicial or detrimental to the best interests of basketball or of the Association or of a Member or its Team, shall be liable to a fine not exceeding $25,000, to be imposed by the Commissioner. The Member whose Player has been so fined shall pay the amount of the fine should such Player fail to do so within ten (10) days of its imposition.</li>
<li>If in the opinion of the Commissioner any other act or conduct of a Player at or during an Exhibition, Regular Season, or Playoff game has been prejudicial to or against the best interests of the Association or the game of basketball, the Commissioner shall impose upon such Player a fine not exceeding $25,000, or may order for a time the suspension of any such Player from any connection or duties with Exhibition, Regular Season, or Playoff games, or he may order both such fine and suspension.</li>
<li>The Commissioner shall have the power to suspend for a definite or indefinite period, or to impose a fine not exceeding $25,000, or inflict both such suspension and fine upon any Player who, in his opinion, shall have been gUilty of conduct that does not conform to standards of morality or fair play, that does not comply at all times with all federal, state, and local laws, or that is prejudicial or detrimental to the Association.</li>
<li>Any Player who, directly or indirectly, entices, induces, persuades or attempts to entice, induce, or persuade any Player, Coach, Trainer, General Manager or any other person who is under contract to any other Member of the Association to enter into negotiations for or relating to his services or negotiates or contracts for such services shall, on being charged with such tampering, be given an opportunity to answer such charges after due notice and the Commissioner shall have the power to decide whether or not the charges have been sustained; in the event his decision is that the charges have been sustained, then the Commissioner shall have the power to suspend such Player for a definite or indefinite period, or to impose a fine not exceeding $25,000, or inflict both such suspension and fine upon any such Player.</li>
<li>Any Player who, directly or indirectly, wagers money or anything of value on the outcome of any game played by a Team in the league operated by the Association shall, on being charged with such wagering, be given an opportunity to answer such charges after due notice, and the decision of the Commissioner shall be final, binding and conclusive and unappealable. The penalty for such offense shall be within the absolute and sole discretion of the Commissioner and may include a fine, suspension, expUlsion and/or perpetual disqualification from further association with the Association or any of its Members.</li>
<li>Except for a penalty imposed under Paragraph (g) of this Article 35, the decisions and acts of the Commissioner pursuant to Article 35 shall be appealable to the Board of Governors who shall determine such appeals in accordance with such rules and regulations as may be adopted by the Board in its absolute and sole discretion.</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">A.1.2</span> EXCERPT FROM BY-LAWS OF THE ASSOCIATION<a href="national-basketball-association-uniform-player-contract.html#excerpt-from-by-laws-of-the-association" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>5.01. <em>Waiver Right.</em> Except for sales and trading between Members in accordance with these By-Laws, no Member shall sell, option or otherwise assign the contract with, right to the services of, or right to negotiate with, a Player without complying with the waiver procedure prescribed by these By-Laws.</p>
<p>5.02. <em>Waiver Price.</em> The waiver price shall be $1,000 per Player.</p>
<p>5.03. <em>Waiver Procedure.</em> A Member desiring to secure waivers on a Player shall notify the Commissioner or the Commissioner’s designee, who shall, on behalf of such Member, immediately notify all other Members of the waiver request. Such Player shall be assumed to have been waived unless a Member shall timely notify the Commissioner or the Commissioner’s designee by facsimile or electronic mail, and telephone, of a claim to the rights of such Player. Once a Member has notified the Commissioner or the Commissioner’s designee to attempt to secure waivers on a Player, such notice may not be withdrawn. A Player remains the financial responsibility of the Member placing him on waivers until the waiver period set by the Commissioner or the Commissioner’s designee has expired.</p>
<p>5.04. <em>Waiver Period.</em> If the Commissioner or the Commissioner’s designee distributes notice of request for waiver at any time between August 15 and the end of the next Season, any Members wishing to claim rights to the Player shall do so by giving notice by telephone and electronic mail of such claim to the Commissioner or the Commissioner’s designee within forty-eight (48) hours after the time of such notice. If the Commissioner or the Commissioner’s designee distributes notice of request for waiver at any other time, any Member wishing to claim rights to the Player shall do so by providing notice of such claim to the Commissioner within ten (10) days after the date of such notice, A Team may not withdraw a claim to the rights to a Player on waivers.</p>
<p>5.05. <em>Waiver Preferences.</em>
(a) In the event that more than one (1) Member shall have claimed rights to a Player placed on waivers, the claiming Member with the lowest team standing at the time the waiver was requested shall be entitled to acquire the rights to such Player. If the request for waiver shall occur after the last day of the Season and before 11 :59 p.m. eastern time on the following November 30, the standings at the close of the previous Season shall govern.
(b) If the winning percentages of two (2) claiming Teams are the same, then the tie shall be determined, if possible, on the basis of the Regular Season Games between the two (2) Teams, during the Season or during the preceding Season, as the case may be. If still tied, a toss of a coin shall determine priority. For the purpose of determining standings, both Conferences of the Association shall be deemed merged and a consolidated standing shall control.</p>
<p>5.06. <em>Players Acquired Through Waivers.</em> A Member who has acquired the rights and title to the contract of a Player through the waiver procedure may not sell or trade such rights for a period of thirty (30) days after the acquisition thereof; provided, however, that if the rights to such Player were acquired between Seasons, the 30-day period described herein shall begin on the first day of the next succeeding Season.</p>
<p>5.07. <em>Additional Waiver Rules.</em> The Commissioner or the Board of Governors may from time to time adopt additional rules (supplementary to these By-Laws) with respect to the operation of the waiver procedures. Such rules shall not be inconsistent with these By-Laws and shall apply to but shall not be limited to the mechanics of notice, inadvertent omission of notification to a Member and rules of construction as to time.</p>

<p>Paragraph 7(b) is hereby deleted and the following shall be substituted in place and instead thereof:</p>
<p>“7. (b) The Player agrees, notwithstanding any other provision of this Contract, that he will to the best of his ability maintain himself in physical condition sufficient to play skilled basketball at all times. If the Player, in the reasonable judgment of the physician designated for that purpose by the Team, is not in good physical condition at the date of his first scheduled game for the Team, of if, at the beginning of or during any Season, he fails to remain in good physical condition, in either event so as to render the Player unfit in the reasonable judgment of said physician to play skilled basketball, the Team shall have the right to suspend the Player for a period of one week. At the end of such one-week period, should the Team notify the Player, orally or in writing, that in its reasonable judgment it believes the Player is still not in good physical condition, the Team shall have the right to suspend the Player for successive one-week periods until the Player, in the reasonable judgment of the Team’s physician, is in good physical condition; provided, however, that at the end of each such one-week period of suspension, the Team provides the notice specified above, and provided further that, at the end of any such one-week period and if the player so requests, then the Player shall be examined by a physician or physicians designated for such purpose by the President, or any Vice President if the President is not available, of the American Society of Orthopedic Physicians, or equivalent organization (the”Reviewing Physician”), whose sole judgment concerning the physical condition of the Player to play skilled basketball shall be binding upon the Team and the Player for purposes of this paragraph. The suspension of.the Player shall be terminated promptly upon the failure of the Team to give the Player the notice required at the end of the one-week period or upon the finding of said Reviewing Physician that the Player is in physical condition sufficient to play skilled basketball. In the event of a suspension permitted hereunder, the annual sum payable to the Player under this Contract shall be reduced in the same proportion as the length of the period of disability so determined bears to the length of the season.”</p>
