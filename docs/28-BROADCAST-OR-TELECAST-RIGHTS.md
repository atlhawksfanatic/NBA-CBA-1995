# BROADCAST OR TELECAST RIGHTS

## League Rights.

During the term of this Agreement, the Players Association agrees that the NBA and its Teams have the right to use, distribute, or license any performance by the players, under this Agreement or the Uniform Player Contract, for any form of broadcast or telecast, including over-the-air television, cable television, pay television, direct broadcast satellite television, and any form of cassette, cartridge, or disk system, or other means of distribution known or unknown.

## No Suit.

The Players Association, for itself and present and future NBA players, covenants not to sue (or finance any suit against) the NBA, any of its Teams, or their agents, successors, assigns, or licensees, with respect to the use, distribution, or license, for any form of broadcast or telecast, including over-the-air television, cable television, pay television, or direct broadcast satellite television, and any form of cassette, cartridge, or disk system, or other means of distribution known or unknown, of any performances by any player rendered under this Agreement or prior collective bargaining agreements, or under Player Contracts made pursuant thereto, during any period up to and including the day following the last Playoff game of the 2000-01 NBA Season.

## Reservation of Rights.

The Players Association expressly reserves its rights to bargain collectively on the subject described in Section 1 of this Article XXVIII at the expiration of this Agreement. Such reservation shall not, however, preclude the NBA from contending that the subject described in Section 1 of this Article XXVIII is not a mandatory subject of collective bargaining.
