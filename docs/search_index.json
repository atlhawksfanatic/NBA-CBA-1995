This is the 1995 NBA’s Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) converted to markdown and disseminated in the format you are currently viewing this as. The original version of the 1995 CBA can be found on my Github website atlhawksfanatic.github.io (pdf found here) as a way to cross-reference any potential discrepancies. The original CBA was converted to a text file with pdftools, then broken up by Article and Exhibit through regular expressions into .Rmd files. Those .Rmd files serves as the basis for this bookdown site. The purpose of this project is three-fold: to historically document collective bargaining agreements of the NBA; to provide easier navigation of the CBA through a structured format of each Article and Section; and for me to better understand the CBA through this exercise. I do not own any rights to the CBA and am simply redistributing it in a different format. This is not the official version of the CBA and I am not responsible for any errors that might be present in this document. If you believe you have found an error, please let me know and I will correct it.

No Player Contract shall provide for the waiver by a player or a Team of any benefits or the sacrifice of any rights to which the player or the Team is entitled by virtue of a Uniform Player Contract or this Agreement. 2.6 Minimum Annual Salary. Except with respect to Ten-Day Contracts provided for in Article II, Section 8, and Rest-of-Season Contracts provided for in Article II, Section 9, no Player Contract shall provide for a Salary of less than the following: For the 1995-96 Season: $225,000 For the 1996-97 Season: $247,500 For the 1997-98 through 2000-01 Seasons: (A) Prior to the issuance of the Audit Report for the prior Season, the Minimum Annual Salary shall be the Minimum Annual Salary for the prior Season increased by ten percent (10%). (B) Following the issuance of the Audit Report for the prior Season, the Minimum Annual Salary shall be the Minimum Annual Salary for the prior Season increased by the greater of ten percent (10%) or the percentage by which BRI for the prior Season increased over BRI for the Season immediately preceding such prior Season. Once the Audit Report for the prior Season is issued, any Player Contract that provides for the Minimum Annual Salary calculated pursuant to subsection (A) above shall be deemed amended to provide for the Minimum Annual Salary calculated pursuant to this subsection (B). Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6(a) of this Article, no Player Contract between a Team and a player selected in the second round of the NBA Draft, or between a Team and a player not selected in the NBA Draft for which he is first eligible, shall provide, with respect to the player’s first NBA Season, for a Salary of less than the following: For the 1995-96 Season: $200,000 For the 1996-97 Season: $220,000 For the 1997-98 through 2000-01 Seasons: (A) Prior to the issuance of the Audit Report for the prior Season, the Minimum Annual Salary shall be the Minimum Annual Salary for the prior Season increased by ten percent (10%).

In determining whether a Player Contract satisfies the Minimum Annual Salary requirements established by this Section, the allocation of signing bonuses, deemed signing bonuses (pursuant to Article VII, Section 3(b », and other bonuses not contingent upon a player’s or a Team’s attaining a particular level of performance shall be considered as part of the Salary provided for by a Player Contract, provided that such Player Contract makes clear that the Salary for each Season (including bonuses) equals or exceeds the Minimum Annual Salary for such Season. Nothing in this Section shall alter the respective rights and liabilities of a player and a Team, as provided for in the Uniform Player Contract or in this Agreement, with respect to the termination of a Player Contract. 2.7 Promotional Activities. A player may not enter into any contract or other commercial arrangement to perform any of the promotional activities set forth in paragraph 13(b) of the Uniform Player Contract (regardless of whether, in connection with such activities, the player is in any way identified with the Team) on behalf of an entity or person that offers a product or service that competes in the same product or service category as the products or services of a Protected Team Sponsor (as defined in subsection (i) below). The designation of Protected Team Sponsors shall be governed by the following: Prior to each NBA Season during the term of this Agreement, a Team may designate no more than two (2) sponsors of the Team that it seeks to protect against conflicting commercial or promotional activities in the Team’s local marketing area involving that Team’s players (“Protected Team Sponsors”). The designation of a sponsor as a Protected Team Sponsor shall last for one year, from September 1 to the next August 31. If a Team chooses to designate Protected Team Sponsor(s), the Team must notify its players of such designation, and of the product or service categories in which its Protected Team Sponsor(s) compete, on or before the September 1 immediately preceding the year in which the Protected Team Sponsor designation will apply. A Team may not designate a sponsor as a Protected Team Sponsor unless the sponsor conducts business in a product or service category set forth in Exhibit E to this Agreement. Local automobile dealerships and retail shoe outlets shall not be designated as Protected Team Sponsors. Nothing in this Section 7(a) shall prohibit a player from entering into a contract or other commercial arrangement to perform national promotional activities on behalf of an entity or person that conducts business on a nationwide basis. A player’s obligation (pursuant to paragraph 13(e) of a Uniform Player Contract) to participate, upon request, in all other reasonable promotional activities of the Team and the Association shall be deemed satisfied if, during each year of the period covered by such Contract, the Player makes six individual personal appearances and six group appearances for or on behalf of or at the request of the Team (or Team Affiliate) by which he is employed and/or the NBA. Up to two of these twelve appearances may be assigned by the Team and/or the NBA in any year to NBA Properties. The Player shall be reimbursed for the actual expenses incurred in connection with any such appearance, provided that such expenses result directly from the appearance and are ordinary and reasonable. The Player shall also receive compensation from the Team by which he is employed of at least $1,000, in accordance with paragraph 13(e) of the Uniform Player Contract, for each promotional appearance he makes for a commercial sponsor of such Team. Any personal or group appearance required under this subsection (b) must: take place during (A) the period from the first day of a Season through the day of the NBA Draft following such Season, or (B) during the off-season, provided that no player may be required to make more than one off-season appearance in any year covered by his Contract and no player may be required to make such an off-season appearance unless he resides in or is otherwise located in the area where the appearance is to take place; occur in the home city (or geographic vicinity thereof) of the player’s Team (subject to subsection (b)(i)(B) above) or in a city (or geographic vicinity thereof) to which the player has traveled to play in a scheduled NBA game; not occur at a time that would interfere with a player’s reasonable preparation to play on the day of a Team game; not exceed a reasonable period of time; and not require the player to sign autographs as the primary purpose of the appearance. 2.8 Ten-Day Contracts. Beginning on January 5 (if a business day or the next succeeding business day) of any NBA Season, and solely for the purpose of replacing an injured player, a Team may enter into a Player Contract with a player, which Contract may, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 7(c), 16(b), and 16(c) of the Uniform Player Contract, provide that such player will be compensated only for the period actually spent in the service of such Team. The duration of such Contract (a “lO-Day Contract”) shall be limited to ten (10) days or a period encompassing three (3) games played by such Team, whichever is longer, and no Team may enter into such a Contract with the same player more than twice during the course of anyone Season. The Salary payable pursuant to a lO-Day Contract shall not be less than an amount calculated by multiplying the Minimum Annual Salary (as set forth in Article II, Sections 6(a) and (b)) for the NBA Season in which such Contract is executed by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days spent by such player in the service of such Team and the denominator of which is the total number of days of that NBA Regular Season. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in a Uniform Player Contract, a lO-Day Contract may be terminated by written notice to the player and payment of only such sums as required by such Contract. 2.9 Rest-of-Season Contracts. At any time after the start of an NBA Regular Season, a Team may enter into a Player Contract that may provide compensation to a player only for the remainder of that Season (a “Rest-of-Season Contract”). The Salary payable pursuant to a Rest-of-Season Contract shall not be less than an amount calculated by multiplying the Minimum Annual Salary (as set forth in Article II, Sections 6(a) and (b)) for the NBA Season in which such Contract is executed by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days remaining in the NBA Regular Season and the denominator of which is the total number of days of that NBA Regular Season. 2.10 General. Any oral or written agreement between a player and a Team concerning terms and conditions of employment shall be reduced to writing in the form of a Uniform Player Contract or an amendment thereto as soon as practicable. Immediately upon the consummation of any such agreement, the Team shall notify the NBA by facsimile or e-mail and provide the NBA with all economic terms of such agreement. As soon as practicable, but no later than three (3) business days following receipt of such notice by the NBA, the NBA shall provide the same notice to the Players Association. Notwithstanding subsection (a)(i) above, neither the NBA nor the Players Association shall contend that any agreement concerning terms and conditions of employment is binding upon the Player or the Team until a Player Contract embodying such terms and conditions has been duly executed by the parties. Nothing herein is intended to affect (A) any authority of the Commissioner to approve or disapprove Player Contracts, or (B) the effect of the Commissioner’s approval or disapproval on the validity of such Player Contracts. A violation of the first sentence of subsection (a) (i) above may be considered evidence of a violation of Article XIII. No player shall attend the regular training camp of any Team, or participate in organized practices with the Team at any time, unless he is a party to a Player Contract then in effect. For purposes of this Section 10(b)), a player shall be considered to be a party to a Player Contract then in effect if such Contract has been extended in accordance with an option in favor of the Team or player permitted by this Agreement. No Team shall make any direct or indirect payment of any money, property, investments, loans, or anything else of value for fees or otherwise to an agent, attorney, or representative of a player (for or in connection with such person’s representation of such player); nor shall any Player Contract provide for such payment. The foregoing shall not, however, prevent a Team from sending a player’s regular paycheck to a player’s agent, attorney, or representative if so instructed in writing by the player. "],["player-expenses.html", "Article 3 PLAYER EXPENSES 3.1 Moving Expenses. 3.2 Meal Expense Allowance.", " Article 3 PLAYER EXPENSES 3.1 Moving Expenses. A Team’s obligation to reimburse a player for “reasonable” expenses related to the assignment of a Player Contract from one Member to another (in accordance with paragraph 10 of a Uniform Player Contract) shall extend to the reimbursement of the actual expenses incurred by such player in moving to the home territory of his new Team, provided that such expenses result directly from the assignment and are ordinary and reasonable, and provided further that, prior to his actually incurring such expenses, the player consults with the Team to which his Contract has been assigned (furnishing a written estimate of such proposed expenses, if requested by the Team), so as to afford such assignee-Team an opportunity to make reasonably comparable alternative arrangements for the move of the player. In the event that the assignee-Team requests an estimate of such proposed expenses, the player shall furnish such estimate to the Team within a reasonable time following the notice of the assignment of the Player Contract. Upon receipt of such estimate from the player, the Team shall, within ten (10) days, either agree to reimburse the player for the expenses set forth in such estimate or make alternative arrangements (at the Team’s expense) for the move of the player. A player whose Contract is assigned from one Team to another shall be reimbursed by the assignee-Team for the cost of a hotel room in a hotel (comparable to that in which such Team’s players are lodged while “on the road”) in the assignee-Team’s home city for up to thirty (30) days following the assignment. A Player whose Contract is assigned from one Team to another shall receive from the assignee-Team a sum equal to three months’ rent on his living quarters in the city from which he is assigned; provided, however, that such payment shall be made only and to the extent that the player is legally obligated for such rent, and shall not exceed $1,500 per month. Prior to its reimbursing an assigned player as provided in this Section, an assignee-Team may require satisfactory proof that the player has paid the amounts for which he seeks reimbursement, and, in the case of rent reimbursements, satisfactory proof that the player is legally obligated to pay such rent and the amount thereof. Upon notice to the player, the assignee-Team may, as an alternative to reimbursement, pay the expenses incurred upon assignment (in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section) directly to the persons, firms, or corporations involved. So as to minimize the potential liability of NBA Teams under this Section, a player who does not establish permanent or year-round residence in the home city (or geographic vicinity thereof) of the Team by which he is employed shall use his best efforts (i) to obtain a short-term lease on the living quarters he selects, and (ii) to procure lease provisions authorizing him to sublet such premises and/or granting such Team the option to take over such lease in the event the Contract of such player is assigned to another NBA Team. 3.2 Meal Expense Allowance. The meal expense allowance, provided for in paragraph 4 of a Uniform Player Contract, shall be as follows: For the 1995-96 Season: $80 per day. For the 1996-97 through 2000-01 Seasons: $80 plus a cost of living adjustment (which shall be calculated by applying to $80 the percentage increase in the national Consumer Price Index between October 1995 and October of the then-current Season, and which shall be rounded off to the nearest whole dollar) per day. When a Team is “on the road” for less than a full day, a partial meal expense shall be paid based upon the time of departure from or time of arrival in the Team’s home city, in accordance with the following: Departure-after 9:00 a.m. or arrival before 7:00 a.m., no meal expense allowance for breakfast. Departure after 1:00 p.m. or arrival before 11:30 a.m., no meal expense allowance for lunch. Departure after 7:00 p.m. or arrival before 5:30 p.m., no meal expense allowance for dinner. For purposes of this Section 2(b), the meal expense allowance for breakfast shall be deemed to be 18% of the applicable daily meal expense allowance (rounded off to the nearest whole dollar); the meal expense allowance for lunch shall be deemed to be 28% of the applicable daily meal expense allowance (rounded off to the nearest whole dollar); and the meal expense allowance for dinner shall be deemed to be 54% of the applicable daily meal expense allowance (rounded off to the nearest whole dollar). For purposes of this Agreement and paragraph 4 of the Uniform Player Contract, the “home city” of an NBA Team shall be deemed to include only the city in which the facility regularly used by the Team for home games is located and any other location at which such home games are played, provided that such other location(s) is not more than 75 miles from such city.

Except as set forth below, effective with the 1995-1996 NBA Season, and continuing for the term of this Agreement, the NBA shall provide the following benefits to NBA players and, in the case of Sections (a) and (f) below, former NBA players: Subject to the provisions of Section (a)(3) below, League-wide pension benefits in accordance with the terms of the National Basketball Association Players’ Pension Plan, as restated effective February 2, 1989 (the “Plan”). Beginning with the 1996-97 Season, the Plan will, subject to the approval of the Internal Revenue Service, be amended to provide for the following changes which shall be effective only throughout the period of this Agreement: The “Normal Retirement Pension” payable to a player under the Plan shall be increased to the maximum monthly amount permitted by the applicable benefit limitations under the Internal Revenue Code to be paid to the player at his “Normal Retirement Date” under the Plan (the “Maximum Monthly Benefit”). For purposes of the preceding sentence, the applicable benefit limitations shall be the limitations in effect for the year in which this Agreement is executed. Notwithstanding the foregoing: The benefits payable under the Plan shall at all times be subject to the limitations on benefits under the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the “Code”). If all or any portion of the actuarially determined contributions to be made to the Plan will not be fully deductible under the Code when paid, the Maximum Monthly Benefit shall not exceed the amount which would result in all of such contributions being fully deductible when paid. The parties agree that the determinations described in the preceding sentence, including any actuarial assumptions and projections related thereto, shall be made by the current actuaries of the Plan and any such determinations shall be binding and conclusive. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Maximum Monthly Benefit shall, effective as of the beginning of a Plan Year of the Plan, be adjusted for increases in the cost of living in the same manner as the cost of living adjustment for the dollar limitation under section 415(b)(I)(A) of the Code. In no event, however, shall the adjusted Maximum Monthly Benefit for a Plan Year exceed an amount that would require the actuarially determined contributions to be made to the Plan to fund for such adjusted Benefit for the Plan Year to exceed the actuarially determined contributions made to the Plan to fund for the Maximum Monthly Benefit in effect for the immediately preceding Plan Year by more than five (5) percent. The parties agree that the determinations described in the preceding sentence, including any actuarial assumptions and projections related thereto, shall be made by the current actuaries of the Plan and any such determinations shall be binding and conclusive. The applicable provisions of this Section I(a) shall apply only to those players who had not yet begun to receive a benefit under the Plan as of July I, 1996 and to those players who were receiving monthly benefits under the Plan as of September I, 1996; provided, however, that in the case of those players who were receiving monthly benefits under the Plan as of September I, 1996, this section I(a) shall apply only with respect to benefit payments to be made on or after September 1, 1996 and shall not require the recalculation of benefit payments made prior to such date. The actuarial reduction for the “Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity” (as defined under section 1.29 of the Plan) for married players and their spouses currently provided under section 3.10 of the Plan shall be eliminated. The preceding sentence shall apply only with respect to benefit payments commencing on or after September 1, 1996 in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity and, in the case of a player receiving monthly benefit payments under the Plan as of September 1, 1996, only if such benefit payments are currently being made in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity. The “Normal Retirement Benefit” payable to a Pre-1965 Player under Article XX of the Plan shall be increased to $200 per month for each “Year of Pre-1965 Credited Service”; provided, however, that the benefits payable under the Plan to Pre-1965 Players shall at all times be subject to the limitations on benefits under the Code. The benefit to be paid in accordance with the preceding sentence shall apply only with respect to benefit payments to be made on or after September 1, 1996 and shall not require the recalculation of benefit payments made prior to such date. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement: (i) if any change or amendment made to the Code, or the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), or to any regulations (whether final, temporary or proposed regulations) or rulings issued thereunder; or (ii) if any interpretation, application or enforcement (or any proposed interpretation, application or enforcement), by a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States or by the Internal Revenue Service, of the Code, ERISA, or any regulations or rulings issued thereunder; or (iii) if any regulations (whether final, temporary or proposed regulations) or rulings issued by the Internal Revenue Service under the Code or ERISA; or (iv) if any provisions of this Agreement, including any of the amendments or benefit increases to be provided under the Plan pursuant to this Section, would result in the Plan no longer being a tax-qualified Plan under section 401(a) of the Code, or would require NBA Teams to incur costs over and above any costs required to be incurred to implement the provisions of this Agreement or any prior collective bargaining agreement in order for the Plan to maintain its tax-qualified status under section 401(a) of the Code (provided, however, that such additional costs are incurred solely in connection with the provision of pension benefits to their non-player employees or to non-player employees of affiliates (within the meaning of sections 414(b), (c) or (m) of the Code) of such Teams), then any obligation to maintain and/or make contributions to the Plan pursuant to this Agreement or pursuant to any prior collective bargaining agreement shall terminate; provided, however, that any such termination shall not impair the legally binding effect of any other provision of this Agreement or any prior collective bargaining agreement, nor shall it create any right (x) to unilaterally implement during the term of this Agreement any terms concerning the provisions of pension benefits to the players, (y) to lockout, or (z) to strike. In the event of such termination, the NBA Teams shall provide alternative benefits to the players, at an annual cost (as determined on an after-tax basis) to NBA Teams equal to the annual cost that such Teams would have incurred under the Plan commencing on the date of termination.

Players employed by Toronto and Vancouver (“Canadian players”) shall receive pension benefits of comparable value by means of the Plan and separate pension plans to be established and maintained by Toronto and Vancouver (“Separate Plans”); provided, however, that (i) if the provision of pension benefits under the Plan to the Canadian players would, at any time, result in the Plan being subject to Canadian Provincial Pension Legislation and/or Canadian Federal Tax Laws (to the extent that the application of such tax laws would result in adverse tax consequences to the Plan, the NBA Members and/or the Canadian players), and/or (ii) if the Separate Plans would not, upon their establishment or at any future time, either satisfy U.S. tax qualification requirements or be able to be registered under Canadian Provincial Pension Legislation and/or Canadian Federal Tax Laws, then any obligation to establish, maintain and/or make contributions to both the Plan with respect to Canadian players and the Separate Plans pursuant to this Agreement or pursuant to any prior collective bargaining agreement shall terminate. In the event of such termination, Toronto and Vancouver shall provide alternative benefits to the Canadian players at an annual cost (as determined on an after-tax basis) to Toronto and Vancouver equal to the annual cost that Toronto and Vancouver would have incurred under the Plan and the Separate Plans commencing on the date of termination.

except as provided in subsection (a)(2) below, proceeds received by Properties, net of actual expenses that are directly attributable to the generation of such proceeds, as long as those expenses are consistent with the types and categories of expenses incurred by Properties reflected in the audited financial reports for Properties for the year ended July 31, 1994 (or, in the case of new sources of revenues, as long as the expenses are reasonable and customary, in the opinion of the Accountants), including proceeds derived from the following categories (defined in the same manner as was used in those audited financial reports): (A) international television; (B) sponsorships; (C) NBA-related revenues from NBA Entertainment; (D) the All-Star Game and McDonald’s Championship; (E) other NBA special events; and (F) all other sources of revenue received by Properties other than those specifically excluded under subsection (a)(2) below;

(ii) pursuant to the Events Agreement; and (iii) relating to the following categories (defined in the same manner as was used in the audited financial reports for Properties for the year ended July 31, 1994): (A) licensing; and/or (B) the representation by Properties of third parties. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, “third parties” refers to persons or entities that are not owned or controlled by persons or entities that own or control an NBA team or, if such third party is “an entity related to an NBA team” (as defined below), NBA Properties’ representation does not relate either to such entity’s NBA ownership or NBA players. Subject to Article VII, Section 9 (Players Association Audit Rights), with respect to expenses incurred in connection with all proceeds coming within subsections (a)(l)(v) and (viii) above, all reported expenses shall be conclusively presumed to be reasonable and customary (other than expenses related to sources of revenues that were not reflected in the audited financial report for Properties for the year ended July 31, 1994), and such expenses shall not be the subject of the accounting procedures set forth in Article VII, Section 8 of this Agreement. Such expenses shall be disallowed, however, to the extent that they exceed the ratio of League-wide reported expenses to League-wide reported revenues (the “Expense Ratio”) for that category of revenues set forth in Exhibit C hereto. It is acknowledged by the parties hereto that for purposes of determining BRI: Some NBA Teams have engaged or may engage in transactions with third parties that are owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the persons or entities owning or controlling the NBA Team (such third parties are referred to in this Agreement as “an entity related to an NBA Team”). As provided in subsections (a)(l)(i)-(vii) and (ix) above, the relevant proceeds received or to be received on an accrual basis by any entity related to an NBA Team that come within those paragraphs and that relate to such entity’s related NBA Team shall be included in BRI. To the extent, however, that such net proceeds cannot reasonably be determined for transactions entered into with an entity related to an NBA Team after the date of this Agreement, the Accountants retained pursuant to the provisions of Article VII, Section 8 of this Agreement shall determine a reasonable value which shall be included in BRI for the first NBA Season to which the transaction pertains. For each Season thereafter in which the transaction remains in effect, the same amount - or an equivalent annualized amount if the transaction pertained to less than a full Season - will be included in BRI increased (or decreased, as the case may be) by the amount the League-wide per-Team average for such net proceeds increased (or decreased) over the previous Season. With respect to transactions with an entity related to an NBA Team pertaining to proceeds that come within subsections (a)(1)(ii), (a)(1)(v) and (a)(l)(vi) above that are in effect as of June 21, 1995, the parties agree that the projected amounts to be earned by the entity related to the NBA Team for the 1995-96 NBA Season as reflected in Exhibit D hereto are reasonable and that the methodology employed to determine these amounts, including all allocations of revenues and expenses, so long as the transaction between the NBA Team and the related third party remains unchanged, shall be conclusively presumed to be reasonable. This methodology will be used to determine the applicable amounts for NBA Seasons subsequent to the 1995-96 NBA Season. With respect to the transactions listed below in this subsection (a)(4)(iii) between an NBA Team and an entity related to the Team, the parties agree that, because the proceeds attributable to these transactions cannot be accurately ascertained, the following procedures shall be used for each NBA Season in which these transactions remain in effect: (A) New York Knicks transaction with MSG Network regarding the sale of local media rights (the “MSG Network Transaction”): BRI for the Knicks for the 1995-96 NBA Season shall include an amount equal to the net proceeds included in BRI attributable to the Los Angeles Lakers’ sale, license or other conveyance of all local media rights (including, but not limited to, broadcast and cable television and radio). In each subsequent Season covered by this Agreement, this amount shall be increased (or decreased, as the case may be), for each category of local media rights, by the average of the League-wide average percentage increase (or decrease) for each such category. (B) New York Knicks transactions with related parties involving signage: BRI for the Knicks for the 1995-96 NBA Season shall include $3,000,000 for signage. In each subsequent Season covered by this Agreement, this amount shall be increased (or decreased, as the case may be) by the League-wide average percentage increase (or decrease) in signage as determined in such subsections (a)(1)(v) and (a)(1)(vi), Pursuant to the NBA’s national broadcast and network cable television agreements with NBC and TBS in effect as of the execution date of this Agreement, NBA Teams might receive revenue sharing proceeds in the 1997-98 NBA Season that are attributable, at least in part, to NBA game telecasts in that and prior NBA Seasons (referred to hereinafter as “Revenue Sharing Proceeds”), An amount up to $36 million of Revenue Sharing Proceeds shall be included in BRI for the 1997-98 NBA Season, In addition, Revenue Sharing Proceeds in excess of $36 million (the “Excess Revenue Sharing Proceeds”), if any, shall be included in BRI for the 1997-98 NBA Season to the extent of (i) 50% of the Excess Revenue Sharing Proceeds, plus (ii) the amount, if any, determined by the following calculation: Step 1: add 50% of the Excess Revenue Sharing Proceeds (the “1996-97 Rollback Amount”) to 1996-97 BRI (the “1996-97 Adjusted BRI”); Step 2: multiply 1996-97 Adjusted BRI by .5013; Step 3: subtract from the result in Step 2 Total Salaries and Benefits for the 1996-97 Season; Step 4: if the result in Step 3 is a positive amount, divide such amount by .5013, then include the result in 1997-98 BRI, up to the amount of the 1996-97 Rollback Amount. With respect to revenue sharing proceeds or other contingent payments attributable to NBA Seasons during the term of this Agreement, if any, that are provided for in national broadcast or network cable television agreements that succeed the present NBA/NBC and NBA/TBS agreements (the “Successor Agreements”), such proceeds or contingent payments, if any, shall be included in BRI in a manner to be determined by agreement of the parties, or if the parties do not reach an agreement, in a manner to be determined by the Accountants. “Projected BRI” means the sum of amounts determined in accordance with the following: With respect to BRI sources other than national broadcast or network cable television contracts, Projected BRI shall include BRI for the preceding Salary Cap Year, increased by 8%. With respect to national broadcast or network, cable television contracts, Projected BRI shall include (in addition to amounts determined in accordance with subsection (a)(6)(iii) and (iv) below) the following: (A) for the 1996-97 Season, $200,000,000 shall be included in Projected BRI with respect to the NBA/NBC agreement, and $90,000,000 shall be included in Projected BRI with respect to the NBA/TBS agreement; (B) for the 1997-98 Season, $180,000,000 shall be included in Projected BRI with respect to the NBA/NBC agreement, and $94,000,000 shall be included in Projected BRI with respect to the NBA/TBS agreement; and (C) for the 1998-99, 1999-2000 and 2000-01 Seasons, Projected BRI for a Season shall include an amount equal to the greater of: (i) 108% of the prior Season’s national broadcast and network cable television revenues; or (ii) the actual revenues stated in the Successor Agreements for such Season plus the Revenue Sharing Forecast (as defined in subsection (a)(6)(iv) below). Except with respect to clause (C)(ii) in the prior sentence, the foregoing shall exclude for all purposes any revenue sharing proceeds that are or may be received by the NBA pursuant to such contracts (including the Revenue Sharing Proceeds), which proceeds shall be treated for Projected BRI purposes solely in accordance with subsection (a)(6)(iii) and (iv) below. With respect to the Revenue Sharing Proceeds: (A) $50 million shall be included in Projected BRI for the 1997-98 Salary Cap Year. (B) Additional amounts in respect of the Revenue Sharing Proceeds may be included in Projected BRI for the 1998-99 through 2000-01 Salary Cap Years to the extent determined by the following calculation (which shall be made no later than August 15, 1997): Step 1: Subtract $36 million from the Revenue Sharing Estimate (as defined below); Step 2: Multiply the result in Step 1 by 0.5 (the “Adjusted Rollback Amount”); Step 3: Add the result in Step 2 to 1996-97 BRI; Step 4: Multiply the result in Step 3 by .5013; Step 5: Subtract from the result in Step 4 Total Salaries and Benefits for the 1996-97 Season; Step 6: If the result in Step 5 is a positive amount, divide such amount by .5013, then add the result, up to the amount of the Adjusted Rollback Amount, to the result in Step 2; Step 7: Subtract from the result in Step 6 $14 million (the “Adjusted Revenue Sharing Estimate”); Step 8: The Adjusted Revenue Sharing Estimate, if any, shall be included in Projected BRI for the 1998-99 through 2000-2001 Seasons as follows: Any amount of the Adjusted Revenue Sharing Estimate, up to an amount that would result in a Salary Cap increase of $250,000, shall be included in Projected BRI for the 1998-99 Season; Any amount of the Adjusted Revenue Sharing Estimate that remains after application of (x) above, up to an amount that would result in a Salary Cap increase of $250,000, shall be included in Projected BRI for the 1999-2000 Season; Any amount of the Adjusted Revenue Sharing Estimate that remains after application of (x) and (y) above, up to an amount that would result in a Salary Cap increase of $250,000, shall be included in Projected BRI for the 2000-01 Season. For purposes of this subsection (a)(6)(iii), Revenue Sharing Estimate means an estimate of the total amount of Revenue Sharing Proceeds that the NBA Teams are entitled to receive pursuant to the NBA/NBC and NBA/TBS agreements assuming that the advertising revenues that will be received by NBC and TBS for NBA game telecasts during the 1997-98 Season will equal the average of the advertising revenues received by NBC and TBS, respectively, for NBA game telecasts during the 1994-95 through 1996-97 Seasons. The Revenue Sharing Estimate shall be mutually agreed upon by the NBA and the Players Association on or before August 1, 1997. In the event that the parties are unable to reach agreement on the Revenue Sharing Estimate, such amount shall be determined by the Accountants. With respect to any revenue sharing proceeds or other contingent payments that are provided for in a Successor Agreement with respect to the 1998-99, 1999-2000 and 2000-2001 Seasons, the parties shall mutually agree upon an estimate of the amount of such revenue sharing proceeds or contingent payments, if any, includable in Projected BRI for a Season on or before the August 1 prior to such Season (the “Revenue Sharing Forecast”). In the event that the parties are unable to reach agreement on a Revenue Sharing Forecast, such amount, if any, shall be determined by the Accountants. “Local Expansion Team BRI” means the BRI of the Expansion Teams during their first two Seasons, but not including the Expansion Teams’ share of League-wide revenues that are otherwise included in BRI (including, but not limited to, their share of national television, cable, radio and other broadcast revenues). “Projected Local Expansion Team BRI” means Local Expansion Team BRI for the immediately preceding Season, increased by 8%. “Interim Projected BRI” means a projection of BRI for a Salary Cap Year based upon the Interim Audit Report provided for in Article VII, Section 8. The NBA and each NBA Team shall in good faith act and use their best efforts so as to maximize Basketball Related Income for each Season during the term of this Agreement. 7.2 Calculation of Salary Cap and Minimum Team Salary. Salary Cap. For each Season during the term of this Agreement, there shall be a Salary Cap. The Salary Cap for each Season will equal the greater of: 1996-97: $24.3 million 1997-98: $25.0 million 1998-99: $26.0 million 1999-00: $27.0 million 2000-01: $28.0 million (the “Guaranteed Minimum Salary Caps”); or 48.04% of Projected BRI, less Projected Benefits (as defined in Article IV, Section 2(a), plus or minus any Salary Cap adjustments (pursuant to subsection (d) below), divided by (A) 27 with respect to the 1996-1997 Season, and (B) 29 with respect to each remaining Season of the Agreement (the “Calculated Salary Cap”). Notwithstanding subsection (1) above, in the event that Projected BRI for the 1996-97 Season, plus Projected Local Expansion Team BRI for the 1996-97 Season, less Projected Benefits (including for the Expansion Teams), plus or minus any Salary Cap adjustments (pursuant to subsection (d) below) divided by 29 (the “Expansion Adjusted 1996-97 Salary Cap”), exceeds the Calculated Salary Cap for 1996-97, the Expansion Adjusted 1996-97 Salary Cap will apply for purposes of subsection (a)(1)(ii) above. The Salary Cap for the 1995-96 Season is $23.0 million. In the event that, based upon the calculation of BRI for the 1995-96 Season, the Calculated Salary Cap for the 1995-96 Season would have exceeded $23.0 million, the difference will be added to the Salary Cap for the 1996-97 Season. For purposes of the foregoing calculation only, the Calculated Salary Cap for the 1995-96 Season will equal 48.04% of actual 1995-96 BRI, less Benefits, divided by 27. Commencing on the first day of each Salary Cap Year, the Salary Cap shall be the greater of (i) the Guaranteed Minimum Salary Cap for such Salary Cap Year, or (ii) the Salary Cap for the prior Salary Cap Year (the “July 1 Salary Cap”). The July 1 Salary Cap will remain in effect until August 15, at which time the Salary Cap will be the amount calculated pursuant to subsections (a)(1)-(3) above. Notwithstanding subsection (4) above, in the event that the Audit Report for a Salary Cap Year, beginning with the 1996-97 Salary Cap Year, has not been completed as of the following August 15, then, beginning on August 16 and continuing until the Audit Report is completed, the Salary Cap shall be the greater of (i) the July 1 Salary Cap or (ii) an amount calculated pursuant to subsections (a)(1)- (3) above, except that Interim Projected BRI shall be utilized instead of Projected BRI.The Salary Cap calculated pursuant to this subsection (5) (the “Interim Salary Cap”) will remain in effect until the Audit Report is completed, at which time the Salary Cap will be the amount calculated pursuant to subsections (a)(I)-(3) above. Minimum Team Salary. For each Season during the term of this Agreement, there shall be a Minimum Team Salary equal to 75% of the Salary Cap for such Season. In the event that, by the conclusion of the Salary Cap Year for a Season, a Team has failed to make aggregate Salary payments and/or incur aggregate Salary obligations equal to or greater than the applicable Minimum Team Salary for that Season, the NBA shall cause such Team to make such payments (to be disbursed to the players on such Team pro rata or in accordance with such other formula as may be reasonably determined by the Players Association). Nothing contained herein shall preclude a Team from having a Team Salary in excess of the Minimum Team Salary, provided that the Team’s Team Salary does not exceed the Salary Cap plus any additional amounts authorized pursuant to the Exceptions set forth in this Article VII. Expansion Team Salary Caps and Minimum Team Salaries. The Expansion Teams shall have the same Salary Caps and Minimum Team Salaries as the other 27 teams, except as follows: 1995-96 Season: Salary Cap: 66 and 2/3% of the Salary Cap determined in accordance with Section 2(a) above for the 1995-96 Season (“1995 Expansion Team Salary Cap”) Minimum Team Salary: 75% of 1995 Expansion Team Salary Cap 1996-97 Season: Salary Cap: 75% of the Salary Cap determined in accordance with Section 2(a) above for the 1996-97 Season (“1996 Expansion Team Salary Cap”) Minimum Team Salary: 75% of 1996 Expansion Team Salary Cap Adjustments to Salary Cap and Minimum Team Salary. Beginning in the 1997-98 Season, in the event that Total Salaries and Benefits paid with respect to any Season is greater than 50.13% of BRI for such Season, then for purposes of calculating the Calculated Salary Cap for the subsequent Season, the amount of such overage shall be deducted from 48.04% of Projected BRI for such subsequent Season less Projected Benefits (the “Overage Deduction”); provided, however, that in no event shall the Overage Deduction reduce the Calculated Salary Cap for the subsequent Season by more than $500,000. In the event that an Overage Deduction for any Season exceeds $500,000, there shall be no carry forward of any such excess to a subsequent Season. In the event that 48.04% of actual BRI for a Season is less than 48.04% of Projected BRI for that Season, then for purposes of calculating the Calculated Salary Cap for the subsequent Season, the difference shall be deducted from 48.04% of Projected BRI for such subsequent Season less Projected Benefits. In the event that, in any Season, adjustments to 48.04% of Projected BRI less Projected Benefits are called for pursuant to both this subsection (d)(1)(ii) and the preceding subsection (d)(1)(i), the maximum adjustment to 48.04% of Projected BRI shall equal the greater of the adjustments called for under such subsections. In the event Total Salaries and Benefits paid with respect to any Season is less than 48.04% of BRI for such Season (plus, if applicable, any shortfall against 48.04% of BRI for the prior Season), then for purposes Of calculating the Calculated Salary Cap for the subsequent Season, the amount of such shortfall shall be added to 48.04% of Projected BRI for the subsequent Season less Projected Benefits; provided, however, that in the event there is a shortfall with respect to the 2000-01 Season, the amount of such shortfall shall be paid by the NBA to the Players Association for distribution to all NBA players who were on an NBA roster during the 2000-01 Season no later than September 1, 2001 on such proportional basis as may be reasonably determined by the Players Association. In the event that actual Benefits for any Season exceeds Projected Benefits for such Season, the difference shall be added to Projected Benefits for the Subsequent Season. In the event that actual Benefits for any Season are less than Projected Benefits for such Season, the difference shall be deducted from Projected Benefits for the subsequent Season; provided, however, that in the event there is a shortfall with respect to the 2000-01 Season, the amount of such shortfall shall be paid by the NBA to the Players Association for distribution to all NBA players who were on an NBA roster during the 2000-01 Season no later than September 1, 2001 on such proportional basis as may be reasonably determined by the Players Association. In the event that the Interim Salary Cap for a Season exceeds the Salary Cap for such Season, the difference shall be deducted from the Salary Cap (and, when applicable, the Interim Salary Cap) for the following Season. 7.3 Determination of Salary. For the purposes of determining a player’s Salary with respect to an NBA Season, the following rules shall apply: Deferred Compensation. General Rules: All Player Contracts entered into or extended after the date hereof shall specify the Season(s) in which any Deferred Compensation is earned. Deferred Compensation shall be included in a player’s Salary in the Season in which such compensation is earned. Notwithstanding subsection (1)(i) above, for purposes of an annuity compensation arrangement included in a Player Contract in accordance with Article XXV, Section 3 of this Agreement only, Deferred Compensation shall include only the portion of the cost of the annuity instrument to be paid by the Team after the playing term covered by the Contract, if any, and shall not include any compensation that the player is scheduled to receive after the term of the Contract pursuant to such annuity compensation arrangement. The portion of the cost of the annuity paid by the Team while the player is required to render playing services under the Player Contract shall be included in Salary for the year in which such cost is paid. Over 35 Rule: Notwithstanding any provision in a Player Contract to the contrary, the following provisions are applicable to any Player Contract entered into or extended that, going forward, covers four or more NBA Seasons, including one or more Seasons commencing after such player will reach or has reached age 35 (an “Over 35 Contract”); Except as provided in subsections (ii)-(iv) below, the aggregate Salaries in an Over 35 Contract for Seasons commencing with the fourth Season or the first Season following the player’s 35th birthday, whichever is later, shall be attributed to the prior Seasons pro rata on the basis of the Salaries for such prior Seasons. If a player who is age 32, 33 or 34 enters into an Over 35 Contract covering more than four NBA Seasons, the aggregate Salaries in such Over 35 Contract for Seasons commencing with the fifth Season shall be’ attributed to the prior Seasons pro rata on the basis of the Salaries for such prior Seasons. If a player who has played for his current Team for at least ten consecutive Seasons enters into an Over 35 Contract that is an Extension and that, beginning with the date the Extension is signed, covers more than five NBA Seasons, the aggregate Salaries in such Over 35 Contract for Seasons commencing with the sixth Season shall be attributed to the prior Seasons pro rata on the basis of the Salaries for such prior Seasons. For each Season of an Over 35 Contract beginning with the third Season prior to the First Zero Year (as defined in subsection (vii) below), if the player plays in such Season, then the Salaries of the player for the subsequent three or fewer Seasons covered by the Contract (including any Zero Year) shall, on the July 1 of the first subsequent Season, be aggregated and attributed in equal shares to each of such three or fewer Seasons. Notwithstanding subsection (2)(i) above, there shall be no re-allocation of Salaries pursuant to this Section 3(a)(2) for: any Contract or Extension covering four or fewer NBA Seasons entered into by a player at age 32, 33 or 34; and any Extension that, beginning with the date the Extension is signed, covers five or fewer NBA Seasons and is entered into by a player who has played for his current Team for at least ten consecutive Seasons. For purposes of this Section 3(a)(2) (governing Over 35 Contracts) only, NBA Seasons shall be deemed to commence on October 1 and conclude on the last day of the Salary Cap Year. “Zero Year” means, with respect to an Over 35 Contract, any Season in which the Salary called for under the Contract has been attributed, in accordance with subsection (2)(i), (2)(ii) or (2)(iii) above, to prior Seasons of the Contract. “First Zero Year” means, with respect to an Over 35 Contract, the earliest Season in which the Salary called for under the Contract has been attributed, in accordance with subsection (2)(i), (2)(ii) or (2)(iii) above, to prior Seasons of the Contract. Signing Bonuses. Amounts Treated as Signing Bonuses: For purposes of determining a player’s Salary, the term “signing bonus” shall include: any amount specifically described in a Player Contract as a signing bonus; any Option Buy-Out Amount; at the time of an assignment of a Player Contract, any amount other than increases in remaining payments to be made pursuant to paragraph 3 of the Contract that, under the terms of the Contract, is earned in the form of a bonus upon assignment of the Contract; and payments in excess of $250,000 with respect to foreign players, in accordance with subsection (f) below. Proration: Any signing bonus contained in a Player Contract shall be allocated in equal parts over the number of Seasons (or remaining Seasons in the case of a signing bonus described in subsection (l)(iii) above) covered by such Contract that are fully protected for skill, provided, however, that no portion of a signing bonus contained in a Player Contract that provides for an Early Termination Option shall be allocated to any Season following the Effective Date of such option. In the event that no Season covered by a Player Contract is fully protected for skill, then the entire amount of the signing bonus shall be allocated to the first Season of the Contract or, in the case of a signing bonus described in subsection (l)(iii) above, the Season during which the player’s Contract is assigned. Signing Bonus Credits: Upon the occurrence of an event that determines that a player shall not be entitled to receive an Option Buy-Out Amount (the “non-payment determination”): all amounts that were included in the player’s Salary pursuant to subsection (l)(ii) above for Seasons up to and including the Season in which the non-payment determination is made (the “unpaid amounts”) shall be deducted from the calculation of Total Salaries and Benefits for the Season in which the non-payment determination is made; all amounts that were included in the player’s Salary pursuant to subsection (l)(ii) above for Seasons following the Season in which the non-payment determination is made shall be deducted from the player’s Salary for such Seasons; and the unpaid amounts shall be deducted from the Team’s Team Salary, in accordance with the following: (A) The total amount available to be deducted from the Team’s Team Salary (the “credit amount”) will equal the aggregate of the unpaid amounts less, for each Season in which a portion of the unpaid amounts was included in the player’s Salary and in which his Team’s Team Salary did not fall below the Salary Cap, the smallest amount by which his Team’s Team Salary exceeded the Salary Cap during such Salary Cap Year. (B) The credit amount shall be allocated, in equal parts, over the same number of Seasons over which the unpaid amounts were allocated, beginning with the first Season following the non-payment determination, plus, for each Season following the first Season of such allocation, 10% of the amount allocated to the first Season. (C) If, during the course of any Salary Cap Year in which a credit allocation has been made, the Team’s Team Salary does not fall below the Salary Cap, the full credit allocation for such Salary Cap Year will be carried forward to a subsequent Salary Cap Year. If, during the course of a Salary Cap Year in which a credit allocation has been made, the Team’s Team Salary does fall below the Salary Cap, the amount carried forward, if any, will equal the amount of the credit allocation for such Season less the largest amount by which the Team’s Team Salary fell below the Salary Cap during such Salary Cap Year. In the event a credit allocation is carried forward pursuant to this subsection, such amount shall be deducted from Team Salary in the Season immediately following the last Season in which a portion of the credit amount is then currently being allocated, subject to the terms of this subsection (iii)(C). Extensions: In the event that a Team with a Team Salary at or over the Salary Cap enters into an Extension that calls for or contains a signing bonus, such signing bonus shall be paid no sooner than the first day of the Salary Cap Year covered by the extended term and shall be allocated, in equal parts, over the number of Seasons covered by the extended term that are fully protected for skill. In the event that no Season in the extended term is fully protected for skill, then the entire amount of the signing bonus shall be allocated to the first Season of the extended term. A Team with a Team Salary below the Salary Cap may enter into an Extension that calls for or contains a signing bonus to be paid at any time during the Contract’s original or extended term. In the event that a Team with a Team Salary below the Salary Cap enters into an Extension that calls for or contains a signing bonus to be paid no sooner than the first day of the Salary Cap Year covered by such extended term, the bonus shall be allocated in accordance with the proration rules set forth in subsection (4)(i) above. In the event a Team with a Team Salary below the Salary Cap enters into an Extension that calls for or contains a signing bonus to be paid prior to the first day of the Salary Cap Year covered by the extended term, the following rules shall apply: (A) The signing bonus shall be allocated in equal parts over the Seasons remaining under the original term of the Contract and the extended term that are fully protected for skill; and (B) The Extension shall be deemed a Renegotiation and shall be subject to the rules governing Renegotiations set forth in Section 7 below. Loans to Players. The following rules shall apply to any loan made by any Team to or at the direction of a player: If any such loan bears no interest (or interest at an effective rate lower than 9% per annum), then an amount equal to 9% per annum of the outstanding balance (or an amount equal to the difference between 9% per annum of the outstanding balance and the actual rate of interest to be paid by the player) shall be included in the player’s Salary. No loan made to a player after July 1, 1996 may (along with other outstanding loans to the player) exceed the amount of the player’s Salary for the then-current Season that is fully protected for skill. All loans must be repaid through deductions from the player’s remaining compensation over the term of the Contract (prior to the Effective Date of any Early Termination Option) in equal annual amounts (the “annual allocable repayment amounts”). If a loan is made at a time when the remaining Salary due for the then-current Season that is fully protected for skill is less than the annual allocable repayment amount that would be owed on a loan for the full amount of the player’s Salary that is, fully protected for skill for the then-current Season (the “maximum annual allocable repayment amount”), the maximum loan amount for that Season shall be reduced by the amount by which the maximum annual allocable repayment amount exceeds the amount of remaining Salary that is fully protected for skill. (For example, if a Player has $1 million in Salary in the first Season of a five-year Contract, and a loan is made during that Season at a time when the Player has already received his Salary for that Season, the loan may not exceed $800,000.) Any forgiveness by a Team of a loan to a player shall be deemed a Renegotiation in the Salary Cap Year of such forgiveness and shall be subject to the rules governing Renegotiations set forth in Section 7 below. Performance Bonuses. For purposes of determining a player’s Salary each Season, except as provided in subsections (2) through (4) below, any amounts that may be earned as a bonus based upon the performance of an individual player or a Team (provided such bonus may be included in a Player Contract in accordance with Section 5(f) below), shall be included in Salary only if such bonus would be earned if the Team’s or player’s performance were identical to the performance in the immediately preceding Season. Notwithstanding subsection (1) above, in the event that, with respect to the first Season covered by a Contract or Renegotiation, or the first Season of an extended term, the NBA or the Players Association believes that the performance of a player and/or his team during the immediately preceding Season does not fairly predict the likelihood of the player earning a performance bonus during the current Season, the NBA or the Players Association may request that a jointly selected basketball expert (“Expert”) determine whether (i) in the case of an NBA challenge, it is very likely that the bonus will be earned, or (ii) in the case of a Players Association challenge, it is very likely that the bonus will not be earned. The party initiating a proceeding before the Expert shall carry the burden of proof. The Expert shall render his determination within two weeks of the initiation of the proceeding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection (2), no party may, in connection with any proceeding before the Expert, refer to the facts that, absent a challenge pursuant to this subsection (2), a bonus would or would not be included in a player’s Salary pursuant to subsection (1) above, or would be termed “Likely” or “Unlikely” pursuant to Article I, Section l(z) or (bg). If, following an NBA challenge, the Expert determines that a performance bonus is very likely to be earned, the bonus shall be included in the player’s Salary. If, following a Players Association challenge, the Expert determines that a performance bonus is very likely not to be earned, the bonus shall be excluded from the Player’s Salary. The Expert’s determination that a bonus is very likely to be earned or very likely not to be earned shall be final, binding and unappealable. The fees and costs of the Expert in connection with any proceeding brought pursuant to this subsection (2) shall be borne equally by the parties. In the case of a Rookie or a Veteran who did not play during the immediately preceding Season, a performance bonus will be included in Salary if it is likely to be earned. In the event that the NBA and the Players Association cannot agree as to whether a bonus is likely to be earned, such dispute will be referred to the Expert, who will determine whether the bonus is likely to be earned or not likely to be earned. The Expert shall render his determination within two weeks of the initiation of the proceeding. The Expert’s determination that a bonus is likely to be earned or not likely to be earned shall be final, binding and unappealable. The fees and costs of the Expert in connection with any proceeding brought pursuant to this subsection (3) shall be borne equally by the parties. In the event that either party initiates a proceeding pursuant to subsection (2) or (3) above, the player’s Salary plus the full amount of any disputed bonuses shall be included in Team Salary during the pendency of the proceeding. In the event the NBA and the Players Association cannot agree on an Expert, any challenge pursuant to subsections (2) and (3) above may be filed with the Grievance Arbitrator in accordance with Article XXXI, Sections 2- 6. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3(d), bonuses and other compensation that are within the sole discretion of the player or unrelated to the performance of skilled basketball (such as weight bonuses, bonuses based upon academic achievement or compensation for off-Season workouts) shall be included in Salary. Averaging. In accordance with the rules set forth in Section 5(e) below, a player’s Salary for each of two or more Seasons shall be deemed in certain circumstances to be the average of the aggregate Salaries payable for such Seasons. Foreign Player Payments. Any amount in excess of $250,000 paid or to be paid by or at the direction of any NBA Team to (i) any basketball team other than an NBA Team, or (ii) any other entity, organization, representative or person, for the purpose of inducing a foreign player to enter into a Player Contract or in connection with securing the right to enter into a Player Contract with a foreign player (as defined in Article X, Section 6) shall be deemed Salary (in the form of a signing bonus) to the player. Subject to Article XIII, any payment of $250,000 or less paid by or at the direction of any NBA Team pursuant to subsection (1) above (the “$250,000 exclusion”), shall not be deemed Salary to the player. The $250,000 exclusion may be paid in a single installment or in multiple installments. The $250,000 exclusion, whether used in whole or in part, may be used by an NBA Team whenever it signs a foreign player to a new Player Contract, except that the $250,000 exclusion may not be used, in whole or in part, more than once in any three-Season period with respect to the same foreign player. The $250,000 exclusion, or any part of it, shall be deemed to have been used as of the date of the Player Contract to which it applies, regardless of when it is actually paid. A schedule of payments relating to the $250,000 exclusion, or any part of it, agreed upon at the time of the signing of the Player Contract to which it applies, shall not be deemed a multiple use of the $250,000 exclusion. Notwithstanding subsection (1) above, no amount paid or to be paid pursuant to this subsection (f) shall be counted toward the Minimum Team Salary obligation of such Team in accordance with Section 2(b) or (c) above. 7.4 Determination of Team Salary. Computation. For purposes of computing Team Salary under this Agreement, all of the following amounts shall be included: Subject to the rules set forth in this Article VII, the aggregate Salaries of all active players (and former players to the extent provided by the terms of this Agreement) attributable to a particular Salary Cap Year, including, without limitation: Salaries payable to players whose Player Contracts have been terminated pursuant to the NBA’s waiver procedure (without regard to any revised payment schedule that might be provided for in the terminated Player Contracts). Any amount paid to a retired player in accordance with the player’s Player Contract. Amounts paid pursuant to awards or judgments for, or settlements of, disputes between a Player and a Team concerning Salary obligations under a Player Contract (as allocated over time, where appropriate, in accordance with the terms of the judgment or settlement), except to the extent that such amounts were previously included in a player’s Salary. The aggregate Free Agent Amounts (as defined in subsection (d) below) attributable to Veteran Free Agents that last played for the Team. An amount with respect to a Team’s unsigned First Round Pick, if any, as determined in accordance with subsection (e) below. Value or consideration received by retired players that is determined to be includable in Team Salary in accordance with Article XIII, Section 5(b). The amount of any Salary Cap Exception that is deemed included in Team Salary in accordance with Section 6(j)(2) below. Expansion. The Salary of any player selected by an Expansion Team in an expansion draft and terminated in accordance with the NBA waiver procedure before the first day of the Expansion Team’s first Season shall not be included in the Expansion Team’s Team Salary, except, to the extent such Salary is paid, for purposes of determining whether the Expansion Team has satisfied its Minimum Team Salary obligation for such Season. Assigned Contracts. For purposes of calculating Team Salary, with respect to any Player Contract that is assigned, the assignee Team shall, upon assignment, be deemed to be paying the entire Salary for the then-current Season and all future Seasons. Free Agents. Until a Team’s Veteran Free Agent resigns with his Team, signs with another NBA Team, or is renounced, he will be included in his prior Team’s Team Salary at one of the following amounts (“Free Agent Amounts”): A Qualifying Veteran Free Agent will be included at 150% of his prior Salary if it was equal to or greater than the Estimated Average Player Salary, and 200% of his prior Salary if it was less than the Estimated Average Player Salary. An Early Qualifying Veteran Free Agent will be included at 130% of his prior Salary; provided, however, that the player’s prior Team may, by written notice to the NBA, renounce its rights to sign the player pursuant to the Early Qualifying Veteran Free Agent Exception, in which case the player will be deemed a Non-Qualifying Veteran Free Agent for purposes of this Section 4(d) and Section 6(b) below. A Non-Qualifying Veteran Free Agent will be included at 120% of his prior Salary. Notwithstanding subsections (1)-(3) above, if the player’s prior Salary was equal to or less than the Minimum Annual Salary, he will be included at the then-current Season’s Minimum Annual Salary. For purposes of this subsection (d) only, a player’s “prior Salary” means his Regular Salary for the prior Season plus any signing bonus allocation and the amount of any performance bonuses actually earned for such Season. For purposes of this Section 4(d) only, in the event that a Veteran Free Agent’s prior Contract provides for an increase or decrease in Salary between the second-to-last and last Seasons covered by the Contract of greater than $4 million, such player’s prior Salary shall be deemed to be equal to the average of the Salaries for the last two Seasons of the Contract. First Round Picks. Beginning with the 1995 Draft, a First Round Pick, immediately upon selection in the Draft, shall be included in the Team Salary of the Team that holds his draft rights at 100% of his applicable Rookie Scale Amount, and, subject to subsection (2) below, shall continue to be included in the Team Salary of any Team that holds his draft rights (including any Team to which the player’s draft rights are assigned) until such time as the player signs with such Team or until the Team loses or assigns its exclusive draft rights to the player. In the event that a First Round Pick signs with a non-NBA team, the player’s applicable Rookie Scale Amount shall be excluded from the Team Salary of the Team that holds his draft rights, beginning on the date he signs such non-NBA contract or the first day of the Regular Season, whichever is later, and shall be included again in his Team’s Team Salary at the applicable Rookie Scale Amount on the following July 1 or the date the player’s contract ends (or the player is released from his non-NBA contractual obligations), whichever is earlier, unless the Team relinquishes its exclusive rights to the player in accordance with Article X, Section 3(f). If, after such following July 1, or any subsequent July 1, the player signs another, or remains under, contract with a non-NBA team, the player’s applicable Rookie Scale Amount will again be excluded from Team Salary beginning on the date of the contract signing or the first day of the Regular Season commencing after such July 1, whichever is later, and will again be included in Team Salary at the applicable Rookie Scale Amount on the following July I or the date the player’s contract ends (or the player is released from his non-NBA contractual obligations), whichever is earlier, unless the Team relinquishes its exclusive rights to the player in accordance with Article X, Section 3(f). For purposes of this Section 4(e), the “applicable Rookie Scale Amount” for a First Round Pick means, with respect to any Salary Cap Year, the Rookie Scale Amount that would apply if the player were drafted in the Draft immediately preceding such Salary Cap Year at the same draft position at which he was actually selected. Renouncing. To renounce a Veteran Free Agent, a Team can, at any time, provide the NBA with an express, written statement renouncing its right to re-sign the player, effective no earlier than the July 1 following the last Season covered by the Contract. (The NBA shall notify the Players Association of any such renunciation by fax within two business days following receipt of notice of such renunciation.) In the event of a renunciation, the player’s Prior Team (i) may not resign such player for 56 days after the first game of the following Season (or for 56 days after the first game of the then-current Season in the event such renunciation occurs after the start of the Season, but prior to the 56th day after the first game of such Season), and (ii) thereafter may re-sign such player only to the extent of the Team’s then-current Room (i.e., the Team cannot sign such player pursuant to Section 6(b) below). Long-Term Injuries. Any player who suffers a career-ending injury or illness, and whose contract is terminated by the Team in accordance with the NBA waiver procedure, will be excluded from his team’s Team Salary as follows: If the injury or illness occurs on or after July 1, but prior to January 1 of any Season, then, beginning on the second July 1 following the injury or illness, the Team may apply to the NBA to have the player’s Salary for each remaining Season of the Contract excluded from Team Salary. (For example, if the career-ending injury or illness occurs on August 1, 1996, the Team may apply to have the player’s Salary excluded from Team Salary beginning on July 1, 1998.) If the injury or illness occurs on or after January 1 but prior to July 1 of any Season, then, beginning on the second anniversary of the injury or illness, the Team may apply to the NBA to have the player’s Salary for each remaining Season of the Contract excluded from Team Salary. The determination of whether a player has suffered a career-ending injury or illness shall be made by a physician selected jointly by the NBA and the Players Association. Notwithstanding subsections (1) through (3) above, a player’s Salary shall not be excluded from Team Salary if, after the date on which a career-ending injury or illness is alleged to have occurred but before his Salary is excluded from Team Salary, the player played in more than ten NBA games in anyone Season or in a total of 15 games over two Seasons. Notwithstanding subsections (1) through (3) above, if, after a player’s Salary is excluded from Team Salary in accordance with this Section 4(g), the player plays in 10 NBA games in anyone Season, the excluded Salary for that Season and each subsequent Season shall thereupon be included in Team Salary. If, after a player’s Salary is excluded from Team Salary in accordance with this Section 4(g), the player plays in 15 or more NBA games over two Seasons but did not play in ten games in the first of such two Seasons, the excluded Salary for the second Season and each subsequent Season shall thereupon be included in Team Salary. After a player’s Salary for one or more Seasons has been included in Team Salary in accordance with this subsection (5), the player’s Team shall be permitted at the appropriate time to re-apply to have the player’s Salary (for each Season remaining at the time of the re-application) excluded from Team Salary in accordance with the rules set forth in this subsection (g). Summer Contracts. Except as provided in subsection (2) below, from the day following the last day of a Season until the day prior to the first day of the next Regular Season, a Team may enter into Player Contracts that will not be included in computing Team Salary, provided that such Contracts satisfy the requirements of this Section 4(h) (a “Summer Contract”). Except as set forth in the following sentence, no Summer Contract may provide for (i) any compensation of any kind, including a signing bonus, performance bonus or salary advance, that is or may be paid or earned prior to the first day of the next Regular Season, or (ii) salary protection or insurance of any kind. The only consideration that may be provided to a player signed to a Summer Contract, prior to the start of the Regular Season, is per diem, lodging, transportation, compensation in accordance with paragraph 3(b) of the Uniform Player Contract, and a disability insurance policy covering disabilities incurred while such player participates in summer leagues or rookie camps for the Team. No later than the day prior to the first day of a Regular Season, a Team that has entered into one or more Summer Contracts must terminate such Contracts except to the extent the Team has Room for such Contracts. A Team may not enter into a Summer Contract with a Veteran Free Agent who last played for the Team unless the Contract is for one Season only and provides for a Salary of no more than the Minimum Annual Salary applicable to such Veteran Free Agent. Team Salary Summaries. The NBA shall provide the Players Association with Team Salary summaries and a list of current Exceptions and Base Year Compensations once a month during the Regular Season and once every two weeks during the off-season. In the event that the NBA fails to provide the Players Association with any Team Salary summary or list of Exceptions or Base Year Compensations as provided for in subsection (1) above, the Players Association shall notify the NBA of such failure, and the NBA, upon receipt of such notice, shall, as soon as reasonably possible, but in no event later than two business days following receipt of such notice, provide the Players Association with any such summary or list that should have been provided pursuant to subsection (1) above. 7.5 Operation of Salary Cap Basic Rule. A Team’s Team Salary may not exceed the Salary Cap at any time unless the Team is using one of the Exceptions set forth in Section 6 below. Room. Subject to the provisions of this Section 5, any Team with Room may enter into a Player Contract that calls for a Salary in the first Season of such Contract that would not exceed the Team’s then-current Room. 20% Rule. Except as provided in Sections 5(d) (Banked Room), 6(b)(1) (Qualifying Veteran Free Agent Exception), and 7(b) (Rookie Scale Extensions) below, for each Season of a Player Contract after the first Season, and for each Season of an Extension after the first Season of the extended term (including, in either case, any Season following the Effective Date of an Option or an Early Termination Option), the player’s Salary, excluding performance bonuses, may increase over the previous Season’s Salary, excluding performance bonuses, by no more than (i) 20% of the Regular Salary for the first Season of the Contract, or (ii) in the case of an Extension, 20% of the Regular Salary for the last Season of the original term of the Contract. In the event that the first Season of a Contract provides for performance bonuses, the total amount of Likely Bonuses in each subsequent Season of the Contract may increase by up to 20% of the amount of Likely Bonuses in the first Season, and the total amount of Unlikely Bonuses in each subsequent Season may increase by up to 20% of the amount of Unlikely Bonuses in the first Season. With respect to an Extension, in the event that the last Season of the original term of the Contract provides for performance bonuses, the amount of Likely Bonuses and Unlikely Bonuses in each Season of the Extension after the first Season of the extended term may increase by up to 20% of the amount of Likely Bonuses and Unlikely Bonuses, respectively, in the last Season of the original term. Banked Room. In the event that the first Season of a Player Contract results in Banked Room, the unused portion of such Banked Room may be used in any subsequent Season to provide for an increase in Salary and Unlikely Bonuses over the previous Season’s Salary in excess of that permitted by the 20% Rule. Averaging. If, in accordance with Article VII, Section 5(d) (Banked Room), 6(b)(1) (Qualifying Veteran Free Agent Exception), or 7(b) (Rookie Scale Extensions), the Salary in any Season of a Player Contract after the first Season (or, in any Season of an Extension, after the first Season of the extended term), including any Season following the Effective Date of an Option or an Early Termination Option, increases or decreases over the previous Season’s Salary by more than 20% of Regular Salary in the first Season of the Contract (or, in the case of an Extension, by more than 20% of the Regular Salary in the last Season of the original term of the Contract), the player shall be deemed to have a Salary for each Season of the Contract (or extended term) equal to the average of the aggregate Salaries for each such Season. If, in accordance with subsection (1) above, a Contract (or Extension) with an Early Termination Option would be subject to averaging but the average of the Salaries in the Seasons preceding the Effective Date of the Early Termination Option exceed the average of the Salaries in the Seasons following the Effective Date of the Early Termination Option, then, notwithstanding subsection (1) above, only the Seasons preceding the Effective Date of the Early Termination Option shall be averaged; provided, however, that if the player fails to exercise the Early Termination Option and his Salary increases or decreases in any Season following the Effective Date of the Early Termination Option by more than 20% of the Regular Salary in the first Season of the Contract, the player shall be deemed to have a Salary for each Season following the Effective Date of the Early Termination Option equal to the average of the aggregate Salaries for the Seasons following the Effective Date of the Early Termination Option. In the event a Rookie Scale Contract is extended pursuant to Section 7(b) below, and the Contract is assigned to another Team prior to the subsequent July 1, the player subject to such Contract shall be deemed to have a Salary for the last Season of the original term of the Contract and the extended term equal to the average of the aggregate Salaries for such Seasons. A Contract that is not subject to averaging at the time it is entered into shall not later be subject to averaging, other than as a result of a Renegotiation or Extension. An Averaged Contract shall not later be de-averaged notwithstanding any subsequent renegotiation of such Contract. Performance Bonuses. No Team may enter into a Player Contract containing a performance bonus for the first Season of the Contract that, if earned or paid during the first Season covered by such Contract, would result in the Team’s Team Salary exceeding the Room under which it is signing the Contract. For the sole purpose of determining whether a Team has Room for a new Unlikely Bonus, the Team’s Room shall be deemed reduced by all Unlikely Bonuses in Contracts approved by the Commissioner that may be paid to all of the Team’s players that entered into Player Contracts (including Renegotiations) during that Salary Cap Year. The following provisions shall apply to any Averaged Contract containing a performance bonus: In the event that at the end of any Season, a performance bonus that is included in a player’s Salary for a subsequent Season is determined to be no longer includable in Salary for that subsequent Season, the player’s Salary for such subsequent Season shall be reduced by the amount of such bonus. In the event that, at the end of any Season, a performance bonus that is not included in a player’s Salary for a subsequent Season is determined to be includable in Salary for that subsequent Season, the player’s Salary for such subsequent Season shall be increased by the amount of such bonus. No Futures Contracts. A Team may only enter into a Player Contract with a player that covers at least the then-current Season, unless such Team and player already are parties to a Player Contract covering the then-current Season. 7.6 Exceptions to the Salary Cap There shall be the following exceptions to the rule that a Team’s Team Salary may not exceed the Salary Cap: Existing Contracts. A Team may exceed the Salary Cap to the extent of its current contractual commitments, provided that such contracts satisfied the provisions of this Article VII when entered into or were entered into prior to the execution date of this Agreement in accordance with the rules then in effect. Veteran Free Agent Exception. Beginning on the July 1 following the last Season covered by a Veteran Free Agent’s Player Contract, such player may enter into a new Player Contract with his Prior Team (or, in the case of a player selected in an Expansion Draft that year, with the Team that selected such player in an Expansion Draft) as follows: If the player is a Qualifying Veteran Free Agent, the new Player Contract may provide for Salary of any amount for any Season of the Contract. If the player is a Non-Qualifying Veteran Free Agent, the new Player Contract may provide for a Salary for the first Season of up to the greater of (i) 120% of the Regular Salary for the final Season of the player’s prior Contract, plus 120% of any Likely Bonuses and Unlikely Bonuses, respectively, called for in the final Season covered by the player’s prior Contract, or (ii) 120% of the Minimum Annual Salary for the then-current Season. Salary increases and increases in Unlikely Bonuses in subsequent Seasons shall be governed by the 20% Rule. If the player is an Early Qualifying Veteran Free Agent, the new Player Contract must cover at least two Seasons and may provide for a Salary for the first Season of up to the greater of (i) 175% of the Regular Salary for the final Season covered by his prior Contract, plus 175% of any Likely Bonuses and Unlikely Bonuses, respectively, called for in the final Season covered by the player’s prior Contract, or (ii) 108% of the Average Player Salary for the prior Season (or if the prior Season’s Average Player Salary has not been determined, 108% of the Estimated Average Player Salary for the prior Season). Salary increases and increases in Unlikely Bonuses in subsequent Seasons shall be governed by the 20% Rule. Disabled Player Exception. Subject to the rules set forth in subsection (j) below, a Team may, in accordance with the rules set forth in this subsection (c), sign or acquire one Replacement Player to replace a player who, as a result of a Disabling Injury or Illness (as defined below), is unable to render playing services (the “Disabled Player”). Such Replacement Player’s Contract may provide a Salary for the first Season of up to the lesser of (i) 50% of the Disabled Player’s Salary at the time the Disabling Injury or Illness occurred, or (ii) 108% of the Average Player Salary for the prior Season (or, if the prior Season’s Average Player Salary has not been determined, 108% of the Estimated Average Player Salary for the prior Season). Salary increases and increases in Unlikely Bonuses for subsequent Seasons shall be governed by the 20% Rule. For purposes of this subsection (c), Disabling Injury or Illness means: for the period July 1 through the immediately following November 30, any injury or illness that will render a player unable to play all (or the remainder) of the then-current (or upcoming) Season; and for the period December 1 through the immediately following June 30, any injury or illness that will render a player unable to play all of the following Season. The Exception for a Disabling Injury or Illness that occurs during the period July 1 through the immediately following November 30 shall arise on the date the Team knew or reasonably should have known that the injury or illness would cause the player to miss the then-current (or upcoming) Season, and shall expire 45 days from the date the Exception arises. The Exception for a Disabling Injury or Illness that occurs during the period December 1 through the immediately following June 30 shall arise on the date the Team knew or reasonably should have known that the injury or illness would cause the player to miss all of the following Season; provided, however, that if the Team knew or reasonably should have known prior to the July 1 immediately following the injury or illness that the injury or illness would cause the player to miss all of the following Season, and if the Team does not use the Exception prior to such July 1, then the Exception shall be deemed to arise on July 1. The Exception for a Disabling Injury or Illness that occurs during the period December 1 through the immediately following June 30 shall expire-on the October 1 immediately following the date on which the Exception arises. The determination of whether a player has suffered a Disabling Injury or Illness shall be made by a physician designated by the NBA. The NBA shall advise the Players Association of the determination of its physician within one business day of such determination. In the event the Players Association disputes the NBA physician’s determination, the parties will immediately refer the matter to a neutral physician (to be selected by the parties at the commencement of each Salary Cap Year) to review the relevant medical information and, if requested, examine the player and render, within three business days of his receipt of such information, a final determination, which will be final, binding and unappealable. The cost of the NBA physician will be borne by the NBA. The cost of the neutral physician will be borne jointly by the NBA and the Players Association. Notwithstanding a determination by a physician designated by the NBA that a player has suffered a Disabling Injury or Illness, such player, upon recovering from his injury or illness, may be restored to his Team’s active list, without affecting any right the Team may have to sign a Replacement Player. In no event may a Team enter into a Contract with a Replacement Player pursuant to subsection (c)(4), unless the Disabled Player’s Contract covers the Season following the Season in which the Disabling Injury or Illness occurs.

A player’s Base Year Compensation shall be computed as follows: (A) During the first 365 days from the date a player’s Base Year Compensation goes into effect (“Year One”), his Base Year Compensation will equal the greater of (1) the Salary for the last Season of his preceding Contract or, in the case of an Extension, the last Season of the original term of the Contract (the preceding amount hereinafter referred to as the “Base Year Salary”), or (2) one-third of the Salary for Year One of his new Contract (or extended term, if applicable). (B) During the second 365 days from the date the player’s Base Year Compensation goes into effect (“Year Two”), his Base Year Compensation will equal the greater of (1) 120% of his Base Year Salary, or (2) two-thirds of the Salary for Year Two of his new Contract (or extended term, if applicable). (C) A player’s Base Year Compensation will expire and be of no further effect on the 731st day of his new Contract (or extended term, if applicable). (D) A player subject to a Base Year Compensation as of the effective date of this Agreement in accordance with subsection (4)(i)(C) above shall be treated as if the phase-out rule set forth above was in effect when such Base Year Compensation came into effect. In the event a player who is subject to a Base Year Compensation during the last Season of his Contract signs an Extension or a new Player Contract with his Prior Team, the player shall continue to be subject to a Base Year Compensation in his new Contract or Extension through (A) in the case of a new Contract, the 730th day from the date the player’s Base Year Compensation went into effect or the 365th day from the date the new Contract is signed, whichever is later, and (B) in the case of an Extension, the 730th day from the date the player’s Base Year Compensation went into effect; provided, however, that in the event the player is a Qualifying Veteran Free Agent or an Early Qualifying Veteran Free Agent, and the new Contract would itself subject the player to a Base Year Compensation in accordance with subsection (4)(i)(A) above, then the player shall be subject to a new Base Year Compensation for a period of 730 days from the date the new Contract is signed in accordance with subsection (4 )(ii) above. For purposes of computing such Base Year Compensation pursuant to subsection (4)(ii), the player’s Base Year Salary shall equal the Base Year Compensation applicable in the last Season of his prior Contract or, in the case of an Extension, the last Season of the original term of the Contract. A player’s Base Year Compensation shall be extinguished upon any of the following: (A) The Team Salary of the player’s Team falls below the Salary Cap, unless this occurs prior to the beginning of an extended term that gives rise to the Base Year described in subsection (4 )(i)(D) above; (B) The player signs a Contract with a Team other than his prior Team; or (C) The player is traded, unless the trade occurs prior to the beginning of an extended term described in subsection 4(i)(D) above.

Non-Aggregation. Other than in accordance with subsection (g) above, a Team may not aggregate or combine any of the Exceptions set forth above in order to sign one or more players at Salaries greater than that permitted by anyone of the Exceptions. If a Team has more than one Exception available at the same time, the Team shall have the right to choose which Exception it wishes to use to sign a player. Other Rules. A Team shall be entitled to use the Disabled Player, $1 Million, and Assigned Player Exceptions set forth in subsections (c), (d) and (g) above, respectively, except as set forth in subsections (g)(2) and (3) above, only if, at the time any such Exception arises and at all times until it is used, (i) the Team’s Team Salary is at or above the Salary Cap, or (ii) the amount by which the Team’s Team Salary is below the Salary Cap is less than the amount that would be available to the Team in accordance with the Exception.

The NBA and the Players Association shall jointly engage an independent auditor (the “Accountants”) to provide the parties with an “Audit Report” setting forth BRI, Team Salary and Benefits of each NBA team for the immediately preceding Season. The Audit Report is to be prepared in accordance with the provisions and definitions contained in this Agreement. The engagement of the Accountants shall be deemed to be renewed annually unless they are discharged by either party during the period from the submission of an Audit Report up to January 1 of the following year. The parties agree to share equally the costs incurred by the Accountants in preparing the Audit Report. The Accountants shall submit a draft Audit Report to the NBA and the Players Association, along with relevant supporting documentation, on or before the July 31 following the conclusion of each Salary Cap Year. The final Audit Report shall be submitted by the Accountants to the parties on or before the following August 15. The NBA, the Players Association and the Teams shall use their best efforts to facilitate the Accountants’ timely completion of the Audit Report. Beginning with the Audit Report for the 1996-97 Salary Cap Year, in the event that, for any reason, the Accountants fail to submit to the parties a final Audit Report by August 15, the Accountants shall prepare an interim Audit Report (the “Interim Audit Report”) by such date setting forth the Accountants’ best estimate of BRI and Total Salaries and Benefits for such Salary Cap Year. Such Interim Audit Report shall include: All amounts of BRI and Total Salaries and Benefits for such Salary Cap Year as to which the Accountants have completed their review and, by written agreement of the Players Association and the NBA (waiving their respective rights to dispute such amounts), are not in dispute. With respect to any amounts that are in dispute (whether such dispute would be for the Accountants or the System Arbitrator to decide under this Agreement), the NBA’s good faith proposal as to the proper amount that should be included in the Audit Report. With respect to any amounts as to which the Accountants have not yet completed their review, the portion of such amount, if any, as to which the Accountants have completed their review and, by written agreement of the Players Association and the NBA (waiving their respective rights to challenge such portion), are not in dispute. A projected amount for national broadcast and network cable television revenues, as determined in accordance with Article VII, Section l(a)(6). As soon as practicable after the Interim Audit Report is submitted to the parties, the Accountants shall submit the final Audit Report, including a description of the differences, if any, from the Interim Audit Report. For purposes of determining BRI and Total Salaries and Benefits, the Accountants shall perform at least such review procedures as shall be agreed upon by the parties. In connection with the preparation of Audit Reports for each Salary Cap Year, each Team and the NBA shall submit a report to the Accountants, the NBA and the Players Association setting forth BRI, Team Salaries and Benefits information for such Salary Cap Year on forms agreed upon by the NBA, the Players Association and the Accountants (the “BRI Reports”). The Accountants shall review the reasonableness of any estimates of revenues or expenses for a Season included in any Team’s and the NBA’s BRI Reports for such Season and may make such adjustments in such estimates as they deem appropriate. To the extent the actual amounts of revenues received or expenses incurred for a Season differ from such estimates, adjustments shall be made in BRI for the following Salary Cap Year in accordance with the provisions of subsection (g) below. With respect to expenses deducted by the NBA or the Teams, the NBA and the Teams shall report in BRI Reports only those expenses that are reasonable and customary in accordance with the provisions of Article VII, Section l(a)(l). Subject to the terms of Article VII, Section 1(a)(3) (Expense Ratios) and Section 9 (Players Association Audit Rights), all categories of expenses deducted in a BRI Report completed by the NBA or a Team shall be reviewed by the Accountants, but such categories shall be presumed to be reasonable and customary and the amount of the expenses deducted by the NBA or a Team that come within such expense categories shall also be presumed to be reasonable and customary, unless such categories or amounts are found by the Accountants to be either unrelated to the revenues involved or grossly excessive. The Accountants shall notify designated representatives of the NBA and the Players Association: (i) if the Accountants have any questions concerning the amounts of revenues or expenses reported by the Teams and the NBA or any other information contained in the BRI Reports; or (ii) if the Accountants propose that any adjustments be made to any revenue or expense item or any other information contained in the BRI Reports. In the event of any dispute concerning the amounts (as opposed to includability or the interpretation, validity or application of this Agreement) of any revenues or expenses to be included in the BRI Reports that cannot be resolved among the parties (hereinafter referred to as “Disputed Adjustments”), such dispute shall be resolved by the Accountants after consulting and meeting with representatives of both parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party shall have the right to contest, by commencing a proceeding before the System Arbitrator pursuant to the provisions of Article XXXII of this Agreement, any Disputed Adjustments made by the Accountants whenever such Disputed Adjustments for all Teams are adverse to the party commencing the proceeding in an aggregate amount of $5 million or more for any Season covered by this Agreement. If the Disputed Adjustments for all Teams are adverse to the party commencing the proceeding in an aggregate amount of $5 million or more but less than $10 million for any Season of the Agreement, the parties agree that: (i) the hearing will take place on an expedited basis and will not last longer than one full day, provided, however, that if, despite the reasonable efforts of the parties, the hearing cannot be completed in one day, the hearing shall continue, unless the parties otherwise agree, day-to-day until concluded; and (ii) if the party that brings the proceeding does not prevail after the hearing, then that party shall pay the reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, of the other party for its defense of the proceeding. The immediately preceding sentence shall have no application to proceedings in which the Disputed Adjustments for all Teams adverse to the party bringing the proceeding equal or exceed $10 million in the aggregate. All other disputes among the parties as to the interpretation, validity, or application of this Agreement, or with respect to any Salary or Benefits amount included in a BRI Report, shall be resolved exclusively pursuant to the dispute resolution procedures of Article XXXII. The Accountants shall indicate which amounts included in BRI for a Season, if any, represent estimates of revenues. With respect to any such estimated revenues, the Accountants shall, in preparing the Audit Report for the immediately succeeding Season (“Subsequent Audit Report”), determine the actual revenues received for the prior Season and include in such Subsequent Audit Report the amount of the aggregate difference, if any, between all such estimated revenues for the prior Season and the actual revenues received for such Season (the “Estimated Revenue Adjustment”). 7.9 Players Association Audit Rights. Team Audits. The Players Association shall have the right as part of the annual review of BRI Reports to retain its own accountants (the “Players Association’s Accountants”), at its own expense, after the submission of each Audit Report under this Agreement (the “First Audit”), to audit the books and records of at least five NBA teams (of its choosing) and shall also have the right to review the books and records of the NBA League Office, provided, however, that such review shall be limited to (i) revenue items, and (ii) expense items that appear in the BRI Reports. In the event that, in the opinion of the Players Association’s Accountants, such audit indicates misallocations or miscategorizations of revenues or expenses (other than with respect to matters that constituted Disputed Adjustments in connection with the prior Audit Report) resulting in an understatement of BRI in excess of $1.5 million, they shall submit to the NBA proposed adjustments to BRI consistent with their findings. In the event that the NBA disputes such proposed adjustments, such proposed adjustments shall be deemed to be “Disputed Adjustments” and shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures of Section 8(f) above. In addition, in the event that First Audit Disputed Adjustments in excess of $1.5 million are resolved in favor of the Players Association, the Players Association shall then have the right, that Season, to have the Players Association’s Accountants audit an additional five NBA teams, in accordance with the foregoing procedures (the “Second Audit”). If, as a result of the Second Audit, additional Disputed Adjustments in excess of $1.5 million are resolved in favor of the Players Association, the Players Association shall then have the right, that Season, to have the Players Association’s Accountants audit all remaining NBA Teams. The amount of any and all Disputed Adjustments that are ultimately resolved in favor of the Players Association in accordance with this Section 9(a) shall be added to BRI in the Season in which such resolution is reached. Expense Audit. The Players Association shall have the right to retain the Players Association’s Accountants to conduct one audit, at its own expense, of the expenses incurred in connection with the proceeds that come within Article VII, Section l(a)(l)(viii) regardless of whether such expenses exceed the applicable Expense Ratios set forth in Exhibit C. In the event that in the opinion of the Players Association’s Accountants, such audit indicates a misallocation or miscategorization of expenses resulting in an understatement of BRI, they shall submit proposed adjustments to the NBA consistent with their findings. In the event the NBA disputes such proposed adjustments, such proposed adjustments shall be deemed to be Disputed Adjustments and resolved in accordance with the procedures of Section 8(f) above. The amount of any and all such Disputed Adjustments that are resolved in the Players Association’s favor shall be included in BRI in the year in which such resolution is reached. In addition, in the event that any such Disputed Adjustments are resolved in the Players Association’s favor, the Accountants shall be directed to correct such expense misallocations and/or miscategorizations in the remaining Seasons of the Agreement. System Arbitrator Review. Notwithstanding the foregoing procedures, in the event that any of the Disputed Adjustments set forth in this Section 9 concern the includability or the interpretation, validity or application of this Agreement, such Disputed Adjustments shall be resolved by the System Arbitrator.

If a player is drafted by a Team in either an Initial or Subsequent Draft and that Team does not make a Required Tender to such player, the player will become a Rookie Free Agent on the July 16 following such Draft (for a First Round Pick) or on the September 6 following such Draft (for a Second Round Pick). A Team may at any time withdraw a Required Tender it has made to a player, provided that the player agrees in writing to the withdrawal. In the event that a Required Tender is withdrawn, the player shall thereupon become a Rookie Free Agent. A Team that holds the exclusive rights to negotiate with and sign a drafted player may at any time renounce such exclusive rights, except that, if the Team has made a Required Tender to the player, a renunciation shall not be permitted during the time the player has been given to accept the Required Tender. In order to renounce its exclusive rights with respect to a drafted player, a Team shall provide the NBA with an express, written statement renouncing such exclusive rights. The NBA shall provide a copy of such statement to the Players Association within three (3) business days following its receipt thereof. 10.4 Effect of Contracts with Other Professional Teams. If a player is drafted by a Team in either an Initial or Subsequent Draft and, during a period in which he may negotiate and sign a Player Contract with only the Team that drafted him, either (i) is a party to a previously existing player contract with a professional basketball team not in the NBA that covers all or any part of the NBA Season immediately following said Initial or Subsequent Draft, or (ii) signs such a player contract, then the following rules will apply: Subject to subsection (b) below, the Team that drafts the player shall retain the exclusive NBA rights to negotiate with and sign him for the period ending one year from the earlier of the following two dates: (i) the date the player notifies such Team that he is available to sign a Player Contract with such Team immediately, provided that such notice will not be effective until the player is under no contractual or other legal impediment to sign with such Team; or (ii) the date of the NBA Draft occurring in the twelve-month period from September 1 to August 30 in which the player notifies such Team of his availability and intention to play in the NBA during the Season immediately following said twelve-month period, provided that such notice will not be effective until the player is under no contractual or other legal impediment to play with such Team for said Season. If the player notifies the Team that drafts him by July 1 of any year that by September 1 of such year he will, immediately thereafter or for any future season, be under no contractual or other legal impediment to sign and play with such Team, and provided that on September 1 the player is in fact under no such contractual or other legal impediment, then, in order to retain the exclusive NBA rights to negotiate with and sign the player as provided in subsection (a), such Team must make a Required Tender to the player by September 5 of such year. If the player gives the required notice by July 1 of any year, and the Team that drafted him fails to make a Required Tender by September 5 of such year, the player shall thereupon become a Rookie Free Agent. If, during the one-year period of exclusive NBA negotiating rights set forth in subsection (a) above, the player signs a player contract with a professional basketball team not in the NBA and (i) the player has not made a bona fide effort to negotiate a Player Contract with the Team possessing his exclusive NBA rights or (ii) such bona fide effort is made and such Team makes a Required Tender to such player in accordance with subsection (b) above, then such Team shall retain the exclusive NBA rights to negotiate with and sign the player for additional one-year periods as measured in and in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a). If, during the one-year period of exclusive NBA negotiating rights set forth in subsection (a) above, the player signs a player contract with a professional basketball team not in the NBA and (i) the player has made a bona fide effort to negotiate a Player Contract with the Team possessing his exclusive NBA rights, and (ii) such Team fails to make a Required Tender to such player in accordance with Section (b) above, then in no event shall said exclusive NBA rights be retained. If, during the one-year period of exclusive NBA negotiating rights set forth in subsection (a) above, the Team makes or has made a Required Tender to the player and the player does not sign a player contract with any professional basketball team, then (i) in the case of a player who was previously drafted in an Initial Draft, the next NBA Draft following such one-year period shall be deemed the Subsequent Draft as to such player, and the rules applicable to a player who is subject to a Subsequent Draft will apply, or (ii) in the case of a player who was previously drafted in a subsequent Draft, such player shall become a Rookie Free Agent at the end of such one-year period. Notice under this Section 4 shall be provided in writing by personal delivery or prepaid certified, registered, or overnight mail sent to the Team’s principal address or principal office (as then listed in the NBA’s records), to the attention of the Team’s general manager. For purposes of this Section 4, a “professional basketball team” shall mean any team in any country that pays money or compensation of any kind (in excess of a stipend for living expenses) to a basketball player for rendering services for such team. 10.5 Application to Players with Remaining Intercollegiate Eligibility. A person residing within the United States whose high school class has graduated shall become eligible to be selected in an NBA Draft if he renounces his intercollegiate basketball eligibility by written notice to the NBA at least forty-five (45) days prior to such Draft. If such person is selected in such Draft by a Team, the following rules apply: If the player does not thereafter play intercollegiate basketball, then the Team that drafted him shall, during the period from the date of such Draft to the date of the Draft in which the player would, absent renunciation of intercollegiate eligibility, first have been eligible to be selected, be the only Team with which the player may negotiate or sign a Player Contract, provided that such Team makes a Required Tender to the player each year. For purposes hereof, the Draft in which such player would, absent renunciation of such intercollegiate eligibility, first have been eligible to be selected, will be deemed the “Subsequent Draft” as to that player, and the rules applicable to a player who has been drafted in a Subsequent Draft will apply. If the player, having been selected in a Draft for which he was eligible by virtue of renunciation of intercollegiate eligibility, has not signed a Player Contract with the Team that drafted him in such Draft following a Required Tender by that Team and is not drafted in the Subsequent Draft (as defined in the previous sentence), he shall become a Rookie Free Agent. If the player does thereafter play intercollegiate basketball, then the Team that drafted him shall retain the exclusive NBA rights to negotiate with and sign the player for the period ending one year from the date of the Draft in which the player would, absent renunciation of intercollegiate eligibility, first have been eligible to be selected, provided that such Team makes a Required Tender to the player each year. For purposes hereof, the Draft in which such player would, absent renunciation of intercollegiate eligibility, first have been eligible to be selected, will be deemed the “Initial Draft” as to that player. The next NBA Draft shall be deemed the “Subsequent Draft” as to that player, and the rules applicable to a player who has been drafted in a Subsequent Draft will apply. A person residing within the United States whose high school class has graduated, who is not yet eligible to be selected in an NBA Draft, and who signs a player contract with a professional basketball team not in the NBA, shall thereupon become eligible to be selected in the next NBA Draft, and if so selected, shall be treated as though he were a player referred to in Section 4 above. For purposes of this subsection, a “professional basketball team” shall mean any team in any country that pays money or compensation of any kind (in excess of a stipend for living expenses) to a basketball player for rendering services to such team. 10.6 Application to Foreign Players. For purposes of this Section, a “foreign player” shall mean any person residing outside of the United States who participates in the game of basketball as an amateur or as a professional. A foreign player is eligible to be selected in an NBA Draft held during the calendar year in which such player has his twenty-second (22nd) birthday. Any foreign player who is older than twenty-two (22), and who was not selected in the NBA Draft held during the calendar year of his twenty-second (22nd) birthday, is a Rookie Free Agent. Notwithstanding subsection (b) above, a foreign player who is at least eighteen (18) years old and who has not exercised intercollegiate basketball eligibility in the United States shall become eligible to be selected in an NBA Draft held prior to the calendar year in which he has his twenty-second (22nd) birthday if he expresses his desire to become eligible to be selected in the next NBA Draft by written notice to the NBA at least forty-five (45) days prior to such Draft. A foreign player who exercises intercollegiate basketball eligibility in the United States during the season prior to an NBA Draft shall be subject to the rules regarding completion or renunciation of collegiate eligibility, as set forth in Section 5 above. 10.7 Assignment of Draft Rights. In the event that the exclusive right to negotiate with a player obtained in any NBA Draft is assigned by a Team to another Team, in accordance with NBA procedures, the Team to which such right has been assigned shall have the same, but no greater, right to negotiate with and sign such player as possessed by the Team assigning such right, and such player shall have the same, but no greater, obligation to the Team to which such right has been assigned as he had to the Team assigning such right. 10.8 General. The placement of a Rookie on the Armed Services List, or on any of the other lists described in the NBA By-Laws, or on any other list created by the NBA, shall not extend the period of exclusive negotiating rights which a Team has to any Draft Rookie beyond the period specified in this Agreement. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the NBA, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the NBA Constitution and By-Laws, from prohibiting or otherwise responding to violations by Teams of the exclusive NBA rights obtained in any NBA Draft, as set forth or referred to in this Article. Other than as specifically agreed to herein, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to be an agreement by the Players Association to any provision of the NBA Constitution and By-Laws. A person who has renounced his intercollegiate eligibility and expressed his desire to become eligible to be selected in the next NBA Draft pursuant to Section 5 or Section 6 above shall be entitled to withdraw from such Draft by providing written notice that is received by the NBA seven days prior to such Draft.

No compensation obligation of any kind to another Team, or right of first refusal of any kind, shall be applicable to any Free Agent. 11.2 No Individually-Negotiated Right of First Refusal. No Player Contract, or any Renegotiation, Extension, or amendment of a Player Contract, executed after the date of this Agreement, may include any individually negotiated right of first refusal or other limitation on player movement following the last Salary Cap Year covered by his Player Contract. No right of first refusal rule, practice, policy, regulation or agreement providing for a right of first refusal shall be applied to any player as a result of that player’s entry into a player contract with or the playing with any team in any professional basketball league other than the NBA. 11.3 Withholding Services. A player who withholds playing services called for by a Player Contract for more than thirty (30) days after the start of the last Season covered by his Player Contract shall be deemed not to have “complet[ed] his Player Contract by rendering the playing services called for thereunder.” Accordingly, such a player shall not be a Veteran Free Agent and shall not be entitled to negotiate or sign a Player Contract with any other professional basketball team unless and until the Team for which the player last previously played expressly agrees otherwise.

Neither the parties hereto, nor any Team (or Team Affiliate) or player (or person acting with authority on behalf of such player), shall enter into any agreement, including, without limitation, any Player Contract (including any Renegotiation, Extension, or amendment of a Player Contract), or undertake any action or transaction, including, without limitation, the assignment or termination of a Player Contract, which includes any terms that are designed to serve the purpose of defeating or circumventing the intention of the parties as reflected by all of the provisions of this Agreement.

Upon a finding of a violation of Section 1 above by the System Arbitrator, but only following the conclusion of any appeal to the Appeals Panel, the Commissioner shall be authorized to: impose a fine of up to $2,000,000 (50% of which shall be payable to the NBA, and 50% of which shall be payable to the NBPA-Selected Charitable Organization) on any Team found to have committed such violation; direct the forfeiture of one first round draft pick; and/or void any Player Contract, or any Renegotiation, Extension, or amendment of a Player Contract, between any player and any Team that are both found to have committed such violation.

The Committee shall accept as binding and conclusive the findings of the System Arbitrator (or, in the case of an appeal, the Appeals Panel) that a violation of Section 1 or 2 has occurred. In addition, the NBA reserves any and all rights it may have to take such action and/or assert such claims as may be available to it against a player agent found to have violated Section 1 or 2. The Players Association reserves any and all rights it may have to oppose any action taken or claims asserted by the NBA against a player agent found to have violated Section 1 or 2, including any and all rights it may have to contest the authority of the NBA to take such action. 13.4 Production of Tax Materials. In any proceeding to enforce Section 1 or 2 above, the System Arbitrator shall have the authority, upon good cause shown, to direct any Team, Team Affiliate, or player to produce any tax returns or other relevant tax materials disclosing income figures for the player (non-income figures may be redacted), or disclosing expense figures by the Team or Team Affiliate (non-expense figures may be redacted), which materials shall not be released to the general public or the media and shall be treated as strictly confidential by all parties. 13.5 Valuation Procedures. Any transaction (other than a player appearance called for by the Uniform Player Contract or Group License Agreement) between a player and a Team and/or Team Affiliate after the date of this Agreement that (i) is described as not involving playing services, and (ii) in which the player receives compensation or is being provided with an investment opportunity, shall be disclosed in writing to the League Office and the Players Association prior to or within five business days after the entering into of the transaction. The NBA shall have ten days after such disclosure in which to challenge the transaction, pursuant to the procedures set forth in subsection (c) below, on the ground that: (i) the compensation to the player is greater than a reasonable approximation of the fair market value of the non-basketball services or other consideration provided by the player in the transaction; (ii) the amount of the player’s investment is not commercially reasonable, given the relative risks and rewards of such investment; or (iii) the consideration paid to the player for performing basketball services represents less than a reasonable approximation of the fair market value of such player’s basketball services. If a Team or Team Affiliate enters into a transaction after the date of this Agreement with a retired player who played for the Team within the past five years, in which the retired player is being compensated in excess of $10,000 or is being provided with an investment opportunity, and if the compensation the retired player received from the Team when he was a player was substantially below the then fair market value for his services, then the NBA may challenge the transaction, pursuant to the procedures set forth in subsection (c) below, on the ground that: (i) the compensation to the player substantially exceeds the fair market value of the services or other consideration provided by the retired player in the business transaction; or (ii) the amount of the player’s investment is not commercially reasonable, given the relative risks and rewards of such investment. Any challenge under this Section 5 shall be filed in writing with a business valuation expert jointly selected by the NBA and the Players Association, who shall render a decision within fifteen days after the filing of the challenge. The business valuation expert shall conduct a hearing in which the player or retired player, the Team and/or Team Affiliate, the Players Association, and the NBA are afforded the opportunity to appear and participate. The NBA shall have the burden of proof in the proceeding. The business valuation expert may permit discovery of relevant documents necessary to undertake the valuation. Within ten days of any decision by the business valuation expert, any of the parties may file an appeal with the System Arbitrator, who shall conduct a hearing and render a decision within twenty days of the filing of the appeal. There shall be no right of further appeal to the Appeals Panel. If the NBA prevails in its challenge under this Section 5, the player or retired player and the Team and/or Team Affiliate shall have fifteen days after the date of such determination (or the date of the conclusion of any appeal) in which to renegotiate or terminate: (x) the business transaction, if all parties to the transaction so agree; and (y) in the case of a challenge under Section 5(a), any Player Contract entered into contemporaneously with such transaction, without regard to any time limitations in this Agreement applicable to Renegotiations. If the player or retired player and the Team and/or Team Affiliate do not renegotiate or terminate the business transaction or Player Contract by the conclusion of such fifteen-day period, then, at that time: (xx) in the case of a challenge under Section 5(a), the consideration received by the player, or the value of the investment opportunity (net of any contribution by the player), in each case as determined by the business valuation expert or the System Arbitrator, as the case may be, shall be included in the player’s Salary, subject to the Team’s Room and other Salary Cap rules, and further subject to any allocation over time that the business valuation expert or System Arbitrator determines is appropriate; and (yy) in the case of a challenge under Section 5(b), the difference between (A) the compensation received by the retired player, or the value of the investment opportunity received by the retired player (net of any contribution by the retired player), and (B) a reasonable estimate of the fair market value of the services or other consideration provided by the retired player, or a reasonable estimate of the fair market value of the investment opportunity, in each case as determined by the business valuation expert or the System Arbitrator, as the case may be, shall be included in the Team’s Team Salary, subject to the Team’s Room and other Salary Cap rules, and further subject to any allocation over time that the business valuation expert or System Arbitrator determines is appropriate. If the NBA prevails in its challenge under this Section 5, and the player or retired player and the Team and/or Team Affiliate renegotiate or terminate the business transaction or Player Contract, any revised terms of the transaction or Player Contract shall be promptly disclosed to the NBA and the Players Association, and may, at the request of the NBA, be re-subjected to the procedures of this subsection (c). Any information disclosed to the League Office and the Players Association pursuant to the procedures of this Section 5 shall be treated strictly confidential, and shall not be released to the general public or the media. 13.6 Other Undertakings. No Team shall have a financial arrangement with or offer a financial inducement to any player (not including retired players) not signed to a current Player Contract. Prior to the assignment of any Player Contract, the Team from which such Player Contract is to be assigned and the player whose Player Contract is to be assigned shall be required to divest themselves, on terms mutually agreeable to the player and the Team, of any pre-existing financial arrangements between such Team and such player. The foregoing shall not apply to Deferred Compensation obligations and loans.

(This subsection, however, shall not affect any other rights of any player or the Players Association to contest such action.) 14.3 Individual Negotiations. No NBA Team shall fail or refuse to negotiate with, or enter into a Player Contract with, any player who is free to negotiate and sign a Player Contract with any NBA Team, on any of the following grounds: that the player has previously been subject to the exclusive negotiating rights obtained by another NBA Team in an NBA Draft; or that the player has previously refused or failed to enter into a Player Contract containing an option; or that the player has become a Free Agent. The fact that a Team has not negotiated with, made any offers to, or entered into any Player Contracts with players who are free to negotiate and sign Player Contracts with any Team, shall not, by itself, be deemed proof that such Team failed or refused to negotiate with, make any offers to, or enter into any Player Contracts with any players on any of the prohibited grounds referred to in this Section 3. 14.4 League Disclosures. The NBA League Office shall not knowingly communicate or disclose, directly or indirectly, to any NBA Team that another NBA Team has negotiated with or is negotiating with any Free Agent, prior to the execution of a Player Contract with that player. 14.5 Meet and Confer. During the period from July 1 through the first day of the Regular Season of each year covered by this Agreement, the General Counsel of the NBA (or his designee) shall meet once a week with the General Counsel of the Players Association (or his designee) for the purpose of reviewing (i) each Team’s Team Salary summary and the list of Exceptions then currently available to each Team and (ii) any advice rendered during the previous week by either the NBA or the Players Association regarding the interpretation of the Salary Cap. During the period from the first day of the Regular Season through June 30 of each year covered by this Agreement: the General Counsel of the NBA (or his designee) and the General Counsel of the Players Association (or his designee) shall meet at reasonable intervals upon the request of the Players Association for the purpose of reviewing (x) each Team’s Team Salary summary and the list of Exceptions then currently available to each Team and (y) any advice regarding the interpretation of the Salary Cap rendered since the last such meeting; and if the NBA informs a Team that a specifically proposed assignment or other player transaction would be inconsistent with or in violation of the terms of this Agreement and/or the limitations of the Salary Cap as interpreted by the NBA, the NBA shall promptly notify the Players Association that such an interpretation has been communicated and the basis for such interpretation. The NBA shall provide such notice to the Players Association within two business days following the communication of such an interpretation to a Team. The substance of any communications under this Section 5 may be referred to or used by the NBA or the Players Association in any proceeding. By agreeing to the meeting and notification requirement of subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 5, neither the NBA nor the Players Association intends to waive nor shall be deemed to have waived any attorney-client or other privilege with respect to any communications. The provisions of this Agreement are not intended to create any substantive rights in any party, other than as provided for herein. This Agreement may be enforced, and any alleged violations may be remedied, only as provided for herein. 14.6 Enforcement of Anti-Collusion Provisions. Any individual player, or the Players Association acting in that player’s or any number of players’ behalf, may bring an action before the System Arbitrator alleging a violation of Article XIV, Section 1 of this Agreement. Issues of relief and liability shall be determined in the same proceeding (including the amount of damages, pursuant to Section 10 below, if any). The complaining party will bear the burden of demonstrating by a clear preponderance of the evidence that the challenged conduct was in violation of Article XIV, Section 1 of this Agreement and caused economic injury to such player(s). 14.7 Satisfaction of Burden of Proof. The failure by a Team or Teams to make offers or sign Contracts for the playing services of Free Agents shall not, by itself or in combination only with evidence about the playing skills of the player(s) not receiving such offers or contracts, satisfy the burden of proof set forth in Section 6 above. However, such evidence may support a finding of a violation of Section 1 above, but only in combination with other evidence that either by itself or in combination with the evidence referred to in the immediately preceding sentence indicates that the challenged conduct was in violation of Section 1 and caused economic injury to such player(s). 14.8 Summary Judgment. The System Arbitrator may, at any time following the conclusion of any permitted discovery, determine whether or not the complainant’s evidence is sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact capable of satisfying the standards imposed by Sections 6 and 7 above. If the System Arbitrator determines that complainant’s evidence is not so sufficient, he shall dismiss the action. 14.9 Remedies. In the event that an individual player or players, or the Players Association acting on his, or their, behalf, successfully proves a violation of Section 1 above, the player or players determined by the System Arbitrator to have suffered economic injury as a result of the violation will have the right: to terminate his (or their) existing Player Contract(s) at his (or their) option (however, such termination shall not take effect until the conclusion of a then ongoing NBA Season, if any). Such right of termination shall not arise until the recommendation of the System Arbitrator finding a violation is no longer subject to further appeal and must be exercised by the player within thirty days therefrom. Such player shall immediately become a Free Agent upon such termination; however, any such player may choose to reinstate his Player Contract at any time up until September 15 of that year; and to recover damages as described in Section 10 below. However, if the player terminates his Player Contract under subsection (a) above and does not reinstate it pursuant thereto, he may not recover damages for the period after such termination takes effect.

Any Team found to have committed such a violation for the first time shall be jointly and severally liable for two (2) times the amount of compensatory damages. Three (3) times the amount of compensatory damages, in the event that any of the Teams found to have violated Section 1 have committed such a violation for the second time.

In the event damages are awarded pursuant to Section 10 above, the amount of non-compensatory damages, including any fines, will not be included in any of the computations described in Article VII above. The amount of compensatory damages awarded will be included in such computations. 14.13 Contribution. Any Team found liable under Section 1 above shall have the right to seek contribution from any other Team found liable for the same violation in a proceeding before the Commissioner who shall determine what contribution, if any, is fair and equitable. The Commissioner’s determination with regard to contribution shall be final and binding upon and unappealable by any Team. A contribution determination by the Commissioner may be appealed by the Players Association to the System Arbitrator, except that if such a determination involves fewer than four (4) Teams found to have committed a violation of Section 1 above and allocates damages equally among the Teams found liable, there shall be no appeal to the System Arbitrator. In the event of a contribution determination by the Commissioner, the NBA shall provide the Players Association with the data and information that the Commissioner used or relied upon in making his determination. Any contribution determination appealed by the Players Association to the System Arbitrator shall be upheld unless it is clearly erroneous. 14.14 No Reimbursement. Any damages awarded pursuant to Section 10 above must be paid by the individual Teams found liable and those Teams may not be reimbursed or indemnified by any other Team or the NBA, except to the extent of any award of contribution made pursuant to Section 13 above. 14.15 Costs.

In any of the actions described in this Article XIV, the System Arbitrator shall grant reasonable and expedited discovery upon the application of any party where, and to the extent, he or she determines it is reasonable to do so. Such discovery may include the production of documents and the taking of depositions.

As soon as practicable following the conclusion of such hearing, the Commissioner shall render a written decision, which decision shall constitute full, final and complete disposition of the dispute, and shall be binding upon the Player(s) and Club(s) involved and the parties to this Agreement. In the event such appeal involves a fine or suspension imposed by the Commissioner’s designee, the Commissioner, as a consequence of such appeal and hearing, shall have authority only to affirm or reduce such fine or suspension, and shall not have authority to increase such fine or suspension. In the event a matter filed as a Grievance in accordance with the provisions of Section 2(d) gives rise to issues involving the integrity of, or public confidence in, the game of basketball, and the financial impact to the player of the action being grieved is $25,000 or less, the Commissioner may, at any stage of its processing, order that the matter be withdrawn from such processing and thereafter be processed in accordance with the procedure provided in Section 8(a). 31.9 Escrow Procedure. In the event that a Grievance challenging a Commissioner or Team-imposed fine and/or suspension is filed in accordance with this Article, the amount of any fine or salary lost by virtue of the suspension shall be deposited with an Escrow Agent selected by the NBA and subsequently disbursed in accordance with the provisions of the NBA-NBPA Grievance Escrow Agreement, which is attached and made part of this Agreement as Exhibit F. 31.10 Disputes with Respect to the Terms of a Player Contract.

If such a Grievance is initiated by the Players Association, the 20-day time period referred to in Section 2( c) of this Article XXXI shall commence with the date upon which the Player Contract (or amendment thereto) containing the disputed term or provision was first made available for inspection by the Players Association. If, as a result of the Grievance and Arbitration procedure, a Player Contract is found to contain a term or provision that is not permitted by this Agreement, then (i) such term or provision shall be deleted from the Player Contract and have no force or effect, and the Player Contract shall in all other respects remain valid and binding upon the parties thereto, and (ii) if the Team and the Player agree to reform or revise the Player Contract within 30 days of the Grievance Arbitrator’s decision, such reformation or revision shall be exempted from the rules governing Renegotiations contained in Article VII, Section 7(c). Nothing set forth above shall affect in any manner the Commissioner’s authority with respect to the approval or disapproval of Player Contracts pursuant to paragraph 11 of the Uniform Player Contract; and the fact that the Commissioner has approved or not disapproved a Player Contract containing a term or provision not permitted by this Agreement shall not be referred to in the course of the Grievance and Arbitration procedure and shall not be considered in any manner or for any purpose by the Grievance Arbitrator in connection with a dispute concerning that Player Contract. 31.11 Disputes with Respect to Players Under Contract Who Withhold Playing Services. In addition to any other rights a Member may have under contract or law, including those under paragraph 9 of a Uniform Player Contract, a Member may recover damages in a proceeding before the Grievance Arbitrator when a player who is party to a currently effective Player Contract fails or refuses to render the services called for under the Player Contract. In any such proceeding, where the Grievance Arbitrator determines that damages are continuing to accrue at the time of the hearing, the Arbitrator shall award such damages (if any) as the Member has by then sustained, and the hearing shall remain open to enable the submission of proof on the issue of continuing damages. 31.12 Expedited Procedure. Subject to Article XXXII, Section 1, notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a dispute arising under Article XVII, Article XXX, or Article XXXI, Section 11 of this Agreement, or under paragraph 15 of a Uniform Player Contract (but only insofar as such paragraph provides), or in the event of an alleged breach by a player of paragraph 9 of a Uniform Player Contract, the NBA, or the Players Association, or a Team may request that such dispute or alleged breach be referred immediately to the Grievance Arbitrator. In any such case, the dispute or alleged breach shall be asserted by notice in writing or by facsimile given to the other party or parties, the NBA, and the Grievance Arbitrator. In addition, any disputes or questions that under Articles VII, X, and XI are to be arbitrated pursuant to the Expedited Procedure shall, except with respect to notice, be arbitrated in the manner set forth in this Section 12. The Grievance Arbitrator shall convene a hearing with respect to such dispute or alleged breach at the earliest possible time, but in no event later than 24 hours following his receipt of such notice. If the Grievance Arbitrator is not immediately available and the parties are unable to agree upon another grievance arbitrator, the American Arbitration Association shall appoint such other grievance arbitrator. The award, which shall be issued not later than 24 hours after the conclusion of the hearing, shall be in writing and may be issued with or without opinion. If any party desires an opinion, one shall be issued but its issuance shall not delay compliance with the enforcement of the award. The award shall constitute full, final and complete disposition of the dispute or alleged breach, and shall be binding upon the player(s) and Team(s) involved and the parties to this Agreement. The failure of any party to attend the hearing as scheduled shall not delay the hearing, and the Grievance Arbitrator is authorized to proceed to take evidence and issue an award as though such party were present. 31.13 Threshold Amounts for Certain Grievances. A fine or suspension imposed by a Team shall be appealable to the Grievance Arbitrator only if it results in a financial impact on the player of more than $2,000. A fine or suspension imposed by the Commissioner shall be appealable to the Grievance Arbitrator only if it results in a financial impact on the player of more than $10,000. 31.14 Miscellaneous. Each of the time limits set forth herein may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties involved. In any meeting or hearing provided for herein, a player may be accompanied by a representative of the Players Association who may participate in such meeting or hearing and represent the player. In any such meeting or hearing, the NBA and any other party may attend and be accompanied by a representative who may participate in such meeting or hearing and represent the NBA and any such party. The parties recognize that a player may be subjected to disciplinary action for just cause by his Team or by the Commissioner (or his designee). Therefore, in Grievances regarding discipline, the issue to be resolved shall be whether there has been just cause for the penalty imposed. Nothing contained herein shall excuse a player from prompt compliance with any discipline imposed upon him. If discipline imposed upon a player is determined to be improper by a final disposition under this Article XXXI, the player shall promptly be made whole. Nothing contained in this Article XXXI shall be deemed to limit or impair the right of the NBA or any Team to impose discipline upon a player(s) or to take any other action not inconsistent with the provisions of a Player Contract or this Agreement. Subject to Section 3(c) above, all costs of arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Grievance Arbitrator, shall be borne equally by the parties thereto; but each party shall bear the cost of its own witnesses, counsel, and the like. A Team shall not be required to terminate a Player Contract under the NBA waiver procedure as a condition precedent to the filing of a Grievance with respect to such Player Contract. To the extent that the decision of the Impartial Arbitrator in In re Otis Birdsong, Dec. No. 87-2, May 14, 1987, is inconsistent with the foregoing, it is hereby overruled. In a proceeding involving the interpretation of a Player Contract, no Player Contract other than the Player Contract that is the subject of dispute shall be admissible in evidence.

At the earliest possible time, but in no event later than the April 30 immediately following its receipt of the information provided by the NBA, the Accountants shall notify the NBA and the Players Association in writing whether or not the NBA has paid or will be obligated to pay Total Salaries and Benefits in an amount that exceeds 51.8% of Projected BRI for the Season in question and shall provide the NBA and the Players Association with the information and calculations on which that determination is based.

During the training camp period (and if the Team does not pay for meals directly), the meal expense allowance shall be paid in weekly installments commencing with the first week of training camp. For the purposes of this paragraph, the Player shall be considered to be “on the road” from the time the Team leaves its home city until the time the Team arrives back at its home city. CONDUCT. The Player agrees to observe and comply with all Team rules, as maintained or promulgated in accordance with the NBA/NBPA Collective Bargaining Agreement, at all times whether on or off the playing floor. Subject to the provisions of the NBA/NBPA Collective Bargaining Agreement, such rules shall be part of this Contract as fully as if herein written and shall be binding upon the Player. The Player agrees (i) to give his best services, as well as his loyalty, to the Team, and to play basketball only for the Team and its assignees; (ii) to be neatly and fully attired in public; (iii) to conduct himself on and off the court according to the highest standards of honesty, citizenship, and sportsmanship; and (iv) not to do anything that is materially detrimental or materially prejudicial to the best interests of the Team or of the League. For any violation of Team rules, any breach of any provision of this Contract, or for any conduct impairing the faithful and thorough discharge of the duties incumbent upon the Player, the Team may reasonably impose fines and/or suspensions on the Player in accordance with the terms of the NBA/NBPA Collective Bargaining Agreement. The Player acknowledges that he has read and is familiar with Article 35 of the NBA Constitution, a copy of which, as in effect on the date of this Contract, is attached hereto. Such Article provides that the Commissioner is empowered to impose fines upon and/or suspend the Player for causes and in the manner provided in such Article. The Player agrees that if the Commissioner, in his sole judgment, shall find that the Player has bet, or has offered or attempted to bet, money or anything of value on the outcome of any game participated in by any team which is a member of the NBA, the Commissioner shall have the power in his sole discretion to suspend the Player indefinitely or to expel him as a player for any member of the NBA, and the Commissioner’s finding and decision shall be final, binding, conclusive, and unappealable. The Player agrees that he will not, during the term of this Contract, directly or indirectly, entice, induce, or persuade, or attempt to entice, induce, or persuade, any player or coach who is under contract to any NBA team to enter into negotiations for or relating to his services as a basketball player or coach, nor shall he negotiate for or contract for such services, except with the prior written consent of such team. Breach of this subparagraph, in addition to the remedies available to the Team, shall be punishable by fine and/or suspension to be imposed by the Commissioner. When the Player is fined and/or suspended by the Team or the NBA, he shall be given notice in writing (with a copy to the Players Association), stating the amount of the fine or the duration of the suspension and the reasons therefor. WITHHOLDING AND ESCROW. In the event the Player is fined and/or suspended by the Team or the NBA pursuant to any provision of paragraph 5 above, the Team shall withhold the amount of the fine or, in the case of a suspension, the amount provided in Article VI of the NBA/NBPA Collective Bargaining Agreement from any Current Cash Compensation due or to become due to the Player with respect to the NBA Season in which the conduct resulting in the fine and/or the suspension occurred (or a subsequent Season if the Player has received all Current Cash Compensation due to him for the then current Season). If, at the time the Player is fined and/or suspended, the Current Cash Compensation remaining to be paid to the Player under this Contract is not sufficient to cover such fine and/or suspension, then the Player agrees promptly to pay the amount directly to the Team. In no case shall the Player permit any such fine and/or suspension to be paid on his behalf by anyone other than himself. Any Current Cash Compensation withheld from or paid by the Player pursuant to this paragraph 6 shall be retained by the Team or the League, as the case may be, unless the Player contests the fine and/or suspension by initiating a timely Grievance in accordance with the provisions of the NBA/NBPA Collective Bargaining Agreement. If such Grievance is initiated and it satisfies Article XXXI, Section 13 of the NBA/NBPA Collective Bargaining Agreement, the amount withheld from the Player shall be placed in escrow, pursuant to Article XXXI, Section 9 of such Agreement, pending the resolution of the Grievance. PHYSICAL CONDITION. The Player agrees to report at the time and place fixed by the Team in good physical condition and to keep himself throughout each NBA Season in good physical condition. If the Player, in the judgment of the Team’s physician, is not in good physical condition at the date of his first scheduled game for the Team, or if, at the beginning of or during any Season, he fails to remain in good physical condition (unless such condition results directly from an injury sustained by the Player as a direct result of participating in any basketball practice or game played for the Team during such Season), so as to render the Player, in the judgment of the Team’s physician, unfit to play skilled basketball, the Team shall have the right to suspend such Player until such time as, in the judgment of the Team’s physician, the Player is in sufficiently good physical condition to play skilled basketball. In the event of such suspension, the Regular Salary payable to the Player for any Season during such suspension shall be reduced in the same proportion as the length of the period during which, in the judgment of the Team’s physician, the Player is unfit to play skilled basketball, bears to the length of such Season. If, during the term of this Contract, the Player is injured as a direct result of participating in any basketball practice or game played for the Team, the Team will pay the Player’s reasonable hospitalization and medical expenses (including doctor’s bills), provided that the hospital and doctor are selected by the Team, and provided further that the Team shall be obligated to pay only those expenses incurred as a direct result of medical treatment caused solely by and relating directly to the injury sustained by the Player. Subject to the provisions set forth in Exhibit 3, if in the judgment of the Team’s physician, the Player’s injuries resulted directly from playing for the Team and render him unfit to play skilled basketball, then, so long as such unfitness continues, but in no event after the Player has received his full compensation for the Season in which the injury was sustained, the Team shall pay to the Player the compensation prescribed in Exhibit 1 to this Contract for such Season. The Team’s obligations hereunder shall be reduced by (i) any workers’ compensation benefits, which, to the extent permitted by law, the Player hereby assigns to the Team and (ii) any insurance provided for by the Team whether paid or payable to the Player. The Player agrees to give to the Team’s coach, trainer, or physician prompt notice of any injury or illness suffered by him that is likely to affect the Player’s ability to render the services required under this Contract, including the time, place, cause, and nature of such injury or illness. Should the Player suffer an injury or illness as provided in this paragraph 7, he will submit himself to a medical examination and treatment by a physician designated by the Team. Such examination when made at the request of the Team shall be at its expense, unless made necessary by some act or conduct of the Player contrary to the terms of this Contract. PROHIBITED SUBSTANCES. The Player acknowledges that, in the event he is found, in accordance with Section 1 of the NBA/NBPA Anti-Drug Agreement, to have engaged in the use, possession, or distribution of a “Prohibited Substance” as defined therein, it will result in the termination of this Contract and the Player’s immediate dismissal and disqualification from any employment by the NBA and any of its teams. Notwithstanding any terms or provisions of this Contract (including any amendments hereto), in the event of such termination, all obligations of the Team, including obligations to pay compensation, shall cease, except the obligation of the Team to pay the Player’s earned compensation (whether current or deferred) to the date of termination. UNIQUE SKILLS. The Player represents and agrees that he has extraordinary and unique skill and ability as a basketball player, that the services to be rendered by him hereunder cannot be replaced or the loss thereof adequately compensated for in money damages, and that any breach by the Player of this Contract will cause irreparable injury to the Team, and to its assignees. Therefore, it is agreed that in the event it is alleged by the Team that the Player is playing, attempting or threatening to play, or negotiating for the purpose of playing, during the term of this Contract, for any other person, firm, corporation, or organization, the Team and its assignees (in addition to any other remedies that may be available to them judicially or by way of arbitration) shall have the right to obtain from any court or arbitrator having jurisdiction such equitable relief as may be appropriate, including a decree enjoining the Player from any further such breach of this Contract, and enjoining the Player from playing basketball for any other person, firm, corporation, or organization during the term of this Contract. The Player agrees that the Team may at any time assign such right to the NBA for the enforcement thereof. In any suit, action, or arbitration proceeding brought to obtain such equitable relief, the Player does hereby waive his right, if any, to trial by jury, and does hereby waive his right, if any, to interpose any counterclaim or set-off for any cause whatever. ASSIGNMENT. The Team shall have the right to sell, exchange, assign, or transfer this Contract to any other NBA team and the Player agrees to accept such sale, exchange, assignment, or transfer and to faithfully perform and carry out this contract with the same force and effect as if it had been entered into by the Player with the assignee team instead of with the Team. The Player further agrees that, should the Team contemplate the sale, exchange, assignment, or transfer of this Contract to one or more NBA teams, the Team’s physician may furnish to the physicians and officials of such other team or teams all relevant medical information relating to the Player. In the event that this Contract is sold, exchanged, assigned or transferred to any other NBA team, all reasonable expenses incurred by the Player in moving himself and his family to the home city of the team to which such sale, exchange, assignment or transfer is made, as a result thereof, shall be paid by the assignee team. Such assignee team hereby agrees that its acceptance of the assignment of this Contract constitutes agreement on its part to make such payment. In the event that this Contract is assigned to another NBA team, the Player (and the Players Association) shall forthwith be notified orally or by a notice in writing, delivered to the Player personally or delivered or mailed to his last known address, and the Player shall report to the assignee team within forty-eight (48) hours after said notice has been received or within such longer time for reporting as may be specified in said notice. If the Player does not report to the team to which this Contract has been assigned within the aforesaid time, or if a proposed assignment is voided as a result of the Player’s failure to report, the Player may be suspended by the assignee team or assignor Team, as the case may be, and he shall lose the sums which would otherwise be payable to him as long as the suspension lasts. VALIDITY AND FILING. This Contract shall be valid and binding upon the Team and the Player immediately upon its execution. The Team agrees to file a copy of this Contract, and/or any amendment(s) thereto, with the Commissioner of the NBA as soon as practicable by facsimile and overnight mail, but in no event may such filing be made more than forty-eight (48) hours after the execution of this Contract and/or amendment(s). If pursuant to the NBA Constitution and By-Laws or the NBA/NBPA Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Commissioner disapproves this Contract (or amendment) within ten (10) days after the receipt thereof in his office by overnight mail, this Contract (or amendment) shall thereupon terminate and be of no further force or effect and the Team and the Player shall thereupon be relieved of their respective rights and liabilities thereunder. If the Commissioner’s disapproval is subsequently overturned in any proceeding brought under the arbitration provisions of the NBA/NBPA Collective Bargaining Agreement (including any appeals), the Contract shall again be valid and binding upon the Team and the Player, and the Commissioner shall be afforded another ten-day period to disapprove the Contract (based on the Team’s Room at the time the Commissioner’s disapproval is overturned) as set forth in the foregoing sentence. The NBA will promptly inform the Players Association if the Commissioner disapproves this Contract. OTHER ATHLETIC ACTIVITIES. The Player and the Team acknowledge and agree that (i) the Player’s participation in other sports may impair or destroy his ability and skill as a basketball player, and (ii) the Player’s participation in basketball out of season may result in injury to him. Accordingly, the Player agrees that he will not, without the written consent of the Team, engage in (x) sports endangering his health or safety (including, but not limited to, professional boxing or wrestling, motorcycling, moped-riding, auto racing, sky-diving, and hang gliding), or (y) any game or exhibition of basketball, football, baseball, hockey, lacrosse, or other athletic sport, under penalty of such fine and/or suspension as may be imposed by the Team and/or the Commissioner of the NBA. Nothing contained herein shall be intended to require the Player to obtain the written consent of the Team in order to enable the Player to participate in, as an amateur, the sport of golf, tennis, handball, swimming, hiking, softball, or volleyball. PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES. The Player agrees to allow the Team or the League to take pictures of the Player, alone or together with others, for still photographs, motion pictures, or television, at such times as the Team or the League may designate. No matter by whom taken, such pictures may be used in any manner desired by either the Team or the League for publicity or promotional purposes. The rights in any such pictures taken by the Team or by the League shall belong to the Team or to the League, as their interests may appear. The Player agrees that, during any year of this Contract, he will not make public appearances, participate in radio or television programs, permit his picture to be taken, write or sponsor newspaper or magazine articles, or sponsor commercial products without the written consent of the Team, which shall not be withheld except in the reasonable interests of the Team or the NBA. The Player agrees that he will comply with the Team’s designation of Protected Team Sponsors, to the extent such designations are in compliance with Article II, Section 7 of the NBA/NBPA Collective Bargaining Agreement. Upon request, the Player shall consent to and make himself available for interviews by representatives of the media conducted at reasonable times. In addition to the foregoing, and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in Article II, Section 7 of the NBA/NBPA.Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Player agrees to participate, upon request, in all other reasonable promotional activities of the Team and the NBA. For each such promotional appearance made on behalf of a commercial sponsor of the Team, the Team agrees to pay the Player $1,000 or, if the Team agrees, such higher amount that is consistent with the Team’s past practice and not otherwise unreasonable. GROUP LICENSE. The Player hereby grants to NBA Properties, Inc. the exclusive rights to use the Player’s Player Attributes as such term is defined and for such group licensing purposes as are set forth in the Agreement between NBA Properties, Inc. and the National Basketball Players Association, made as of September 18, 1995 (the “Group License”), a copy of which will, upon his request, be furnished the Player; and the Player agrees to make the appearances called for by such Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Group License or this Contract, NBA Properties may use, in connection with League Promotions, the Player’s (i) name or nickname and/or (ii) the Player’s Player Attributes (as defined in the Group License) as such Player Attributes may be captured in game action footage or photographs. NBA Properties shall be entitled to use the Player’s Player Attributes individually pursuant to the preceding sentence and shall not be required to use the Player’s Player Attributes in a group or as one of multiple players. As used herein, League Promotion shall mean any advertising, marketing, or collateral materials or marketing programs conducted by the NBA, NBA Properties (or any subsidiary of NBA Properties) or any NBA team that is intended to promote (x) any game in which an NBA team participates or game telecast or broadcast (including Pre-Season, Exhibition, Regular Season, and Playoff games), (y) the NBA, its teams, or its players, or (z) the sport of basketball. TEAM DEFAULT. In the event of an alleged default by the Team in the payments to the Player provided for by this Contract, or in the event of an alleged failure by the Team to perform any other material obligation that it has agreed to perform hereunder, the Player shall notify both the Team arid the League in-writing of the facts constituting such alleged default or alleged failure. If neither the Team nor the League shall cause such alleged default or alleged failure to be remedied within five (5) days after receipt of such written notice, the National Basketball Players Association shall, on behalf of the Player, have the right to request that the dispute concerning such alleged default or alleged failure be referred immediately to the Grievance Arbitrator in accordance with the provisions of the NBA/NBPA Collective Bargaining Agreement. If, as a result of such arbitration, an award issues in favor of the Player, and if neither the Team nor the League complies with such award within ten (10) days after the service thereof, the Player shall have the right, by a further written notice to the Team and the League, to terminate this Contract. TERMINATION. The Team may terminate this Contract upon written notice to the Player (but only after complying with the waiver procedure provided for in subparagraph (f) of this paragraph 16) if the Player shall do any of the following: at any time, fail, refuse, or neglect to conform his personal conduct to standards of good citizenship, good moral character (defined here to mean not engaging in acts of moral turpitude, whether or not such acts would constitute a crime) and good sportsmanship, to keep himself in first class physical condition or to obey the Team’s training rules; or at any time, fail, in the sole opinion of the Team’s management, to exhibit sufficient skill or competitive ability to qualify to continue as a member of the Team; provided, however, (x) that if this Contract is terminated by the Team, in accordance with the provisions of this subparagraph, prior to January 10 of any Regular Season, and the Player, at the time of such termination, is unfit to play skilled basketball as the result of an injury resulting directly from his playing for the Team, the. Player shall continue to receive his full salary, less all workers’ compensation benefits (which, to the extent permitted by law, and if not deducted from the Player’s salary by the Team, the Player hereby assigns to the Team) and any insurance provided for by the Team paid or payable to the Player by reason of said injury, until such time as the Player is fit to play skilled basketball, but not beyond the Season during which such termination occurred; and provided, further, (y) that if this Contract is terminated by the Team, in accordance with the provisions of this subparagraph, during the period from the January 10 of any Regular Season through the end of such Regular Season, the Player shall be entitled to receive his full salary for said Season; or at any time, fail, refuse, or neglect to render his services hereunder or in any other manner materially breach this Contract. If this Contract is terminated by the Team by reason of the Player’s failure to render his services hereunder due to disability caused by an injury to the Player resulting directly from his playing for the Team and rendering him unfit to play skilled basketball, and notice of such injury is given by the Player as provided herein, the Player shall be entitled to receive his full salary for the Season in which the injury was sustained, less all workers’ compensation benefits (which, to the extent permitted by law, and if not deducted from the Player’s salary by the Team, the Player hereby assigns to the Team) and any insurance provided for by the Team paid or payable to the Player by reason of said injury. Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph 16(b) above, if this Contract is terminated by the Team prior to the first game of a Regular Season by reason of the Player’s failure to render his services hereunder due to an injury or condition sustained or suffered during a preceding Season, or after such Season but prior to the Player’s participation in any basketball practice or game played for the Team, payment of the Player’s board, lodging, and expense allowance during the training camp period, payment of the reasonable traveling expenses of the Player to his home city, and the expert training and coaching provided by the Team to the Player during the training season shall be full payment to the Player. If this Contract is terminated by the Team during the period designated by the Team for attendance at training camp, payment by the Team of any compensation earned through the date of termination under paragraph 3(b) above, payment of the Player’s board, lodging, and expense allowance during such period to the date of termination, payment of the reasonable traveling expenses of the Player to his home city, and the expert training and coaching provided by the Team to the Player during the training season shall be full payment to the Player. If this Contract is terminated by the Team during any Season, except in the case provided for in subparagraphs (a)(ii) and (b) of this paragraph 16, the Player shall be entitled to receive as full payment hereunder a sum of money which, when added to the salary which he has already received during such Season, will represent the same proportionate amount of the annual sum set forth in Exhibit 1 hereto as the number of days of such Regular Season then past bears to the total number of days of such Regular Season, plus the reasonable traveling expenses of the Player to his home.(f) If the Team proposes to terminate this Contract in accordance with subparagraph (a) of this paragraph 16, the applicable waiver procedure shall be as follows: The Team shall request the NBA Commissioner to request waivers from all other clubs. Such waiver request must state that it is for the purpose of terminating this Contract and it may not be withdrawn. Upon receipt of the waiver request, any other team may claim assignment of this Contract at such waiver price as may be fixed by the League, the priority of claims to be determined in accordance with the NBA Constitution and By-Laws. If this Contract is so claimed, the Team agrees that it shall, upon the assignment of this Contract to the claiming team, notify the Player of such assignment as provided in paragraph 1O(c) hereof, and the Player agrees he shall report to the assignee team as provided in said paragraph 1O(c). If the Contract is not claimed, the Team shall promptly deliver written notice of termination to the Player at the expiration of the waiver period. The NBA shall promptly notify the Players Association of the disposition of any waiver request. To the extent not inconsistent with the foregoing provisions of this subparagraph (f), the waiver procedures set forth in the NBA Constitution and By-Laws, a copy of which, as in effect on the date of this Contract, is attached hereto, shall govern. Upon any termination of this Contract by the Player, all obligations of the Team to pay compensation shall cease on the date of termination, except the obligation of the Team to pay the Player’s compensation to said date. DISPUTES. In the event of any dispute arising between the Player and the Team relating to any matter arising under this Contract or concerning the performance or interpretation thereof (except for a dispute arising under paragraph 9 hereof), such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the Grievance and Arbitration Procedure set forth in the NBA/NBPA Collective Bargaining Agreement. PLAYER NOT A MEMBER. Nothing contained in this Contract or in any provision of the NBA Constitution and By-Laws shall be construed to constitute the Player a member of the NBA or to confer upon him any of the rights or privileges of a member thereof. RELEASE. The Player hereby releases and waives every claim he may have against the NBA and its related entities and every member of the NBA, and against every director, officer, owner, stockholder, trustee, partner, and employee of the NBA and its related entities and/or any member of the NBA and their related entities (excluding persons employed as players by any such member), and against any person retained by the NBA and/or the Players Association in connection with the NBA/NBPA Anti-Drug Agreement, the Grievance Arbitrator, and any other arbitrator or expert retained by the NBA and/or the Players Association under the terms of the NBA/NBPA Collective Bargaining Agreement, arising out of or in connection with (i) any injury that is subject to the provisions of paragraph 7, (ii) any fighting or other form of violent and/or, unsportsmanlike conduct occurring during the course of any practice and/or any Exhibition, Regular Season, and/or Playoff game (on or adjacent to the playing floor or any facility used for practices or games), (iii) the testing procedures or the imposition of any penalties set forth in paragraph 8 hereof and in the NBA/NBPA Anti-Drug Agreement, or (iv) any injury suffered in the course of his employment as to which he has or would have a claim for workers’ compensation benefits. The foregoing shall not apply to any claim of medical malpractice against a Team-affiliated physician or other medical personnel. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Contract (including any Exhibits hereto) contains the entire agreement between the parties and sets forth all components of the Player’s compensation from the Team or any person or entity affiliated with, related to, or controlled by the Team, or any person or entity owning an interest in the Team, and there are no undisclosed agreements of any kind, express or implied, oral or written, promises, undertakings, representations, commitments, inducements, assurances of intent, or understandings of any kind that have not been disclosed to the NBA (a) involving consideration of any kind to be paid, furnished, or made available to the Player, or any person or entity controlled by or related to the Player, by the Team or any person or entity affiliated with, related to, or controlled by the Team, or any person or entity owning an interest in the Team, either during the term of this Contract or thereafter, or (b) concerning any future renegotiation, extension, or amendment of this Contract or the entry into any new Player Contract.

Each Member, at the direction of the Board of Governors or the Commissioner, as the case may be, shall take such action as the Board or the Commissioner may direct in order to effectuate the purposes of this Article. The Commissioner shall direct the dismissal and perpetual disqualification from any further association with the Association or any of its Members, of any Player found by the Commissioner after a hearing to have been guilty of offering, agreeing, conspiring, aiding or attempting to cause any game of basketball to result otherwise than on its merits. Any Player who gives, makes, issues, authorizes or endorses any statement having, or designed to have, an effect prejudicial or detrimental to the best interests of basketball or of the Association or of a Member or its Team, shall be liable to a fine not exceeding $25,000, to be imposed by the Commissioner. The Member whose Player has been so fined shall pay the amount of the fine should such Player fail to do so within ten (10) days of its imposition. If in the opinion of the Commissioner any other act or conduct of a Player at or during an Exhibition, Regular Season, or Playoff game has been prejudicial to or against the best interests of the Association or the game of basketball, the Commissioner shall impose upon such Player a fine not exceeding $25,000, or may order for a time the suspension of any such Player from any connection or duties with Exhibition, Regular Season, or Playoff games, or he may order both such fine and suspension. The Commissioner shall have the power to suspend for a definite or indefinite period, or to impose a fine not exceeding $25,000, or inflict both such suspension and fine upon any Player who, in his opinion, shall have been gUilty of conduct that does not conform to standards of morality or fair play, that does not comply at all times with all federal, state, and local laws, or that is prejudicial or detrimental to the Association. Any Player who, directly or indirectly, entices, induces, persuades or attempts to entice, induce, or persuade any Player, Coach, Trainer, General Manager or any other person who is under contract to any other Member of the Association to enter into negotiations for or relating to his services or negotiates or contracts for such services shall, on being charged with such tampering, be given an opportunity to answer such charges after due notice and the Commissioner shall have the power to decide whether or not the charges have been sustained; in the event his decision is that the charges have been sustained, then the Commissioner shall have the power to suspend such Player for a definite or indefinite period, or to impose a fine not exceeding $25,000, or inflict both such suspension and fine upon any such Player. Any Player who, directly or indirectly, wagers money or anything of value on the outcome of any game played by a Team in the league operated by the Association shall, on being charged with such wagering, be given an opportunity to answer such charges after due notice, and the decision of the Commissioner shall be final, binding and conclusive and unappealable. The penalty for such offense shall be within the absolute and sole discretion of the Commissioner and may include a fine, suspension, expUlsion and/or perpetual disqualification from further association with the Association or any of its Members. Except for a penalty imposed under Paragraph (g) of this Article 35, the decisions and acts of the Commissioner pursuant to Article 35 shall be appealable to the Board of Governors who shall determine such appeals in accordance with such rules and regulations as may be adopted by the Board in its absolute and sole discretion. A.1.2 EXCERPT FROM BY-LAWS OF THE ASSOCIATION 5.01. Waiver Right. Except for sales and trading between Members in accordance with these By-Laws, no Member shall sell, option or otherwise assign the contract with, right to the services of, or right to negotiate with, a Player without complying with the waiver procedure prescribed by these By-Laws. 5.02. Waiver Price. The waiver price shall be $1,000 per Player. 5.03. Waiver Procedure. A Member desiring to secure waivers on a Player shall notify the Commissioner or the Commissioner’s designee, who shall, on behalf of such Member, immediately notify all other Members of the waiver request. Such Player shall be assumed to have been waived unless a Member shall timely notify the Commissioner or the Commissioner’s designee by facsimile or electronic mail, and telephone, of a claim to the rights of such Player. Once a Member has notified the Commissioner or the Commissioner’s designee to attempt to secure waivers on a Player, such notice may not be withdrawn. A Player remains the financial responsibility of the Member placing him on waivers until the waiver period set by the Commissioner or the Commissioner’s designee has expired. 5.04. Waiver Period. If the Commissioner or the Commissioner’s designee distributes notice of request for waiver at any time between August 15 and the end of the next Season, any Members wishing to claim rights to the Player shall do so by giving notice by telephone and electronic mail of such claim to the Commissioner or the Commissioner’s designee within forty-eight (48) hours after the time of such notice. If the Commissioner or the Commissioner’s designee distributes notice of request for waiver at any other time, any Member wishing to claim rights to the Player shall do so by providing notice of such claim to the Commissioner within ten (10) days after the date of such notice, A Team may not withdraw a claim to the rights to a Player on waivers. 5.05. Waiver Preferences. (a) In the event that more than one (1) Member shall have claimed rights to a Player placed on waivers, the claiming Member with the lowest team standing at the time the waiver was requested shall be entitled to acquire the rights to such Player. If the request for waiver shall occur after the last day of the Season and before 11 :59 p.m. eastern time on the following November 30, the standings at the close of the previous Season shall govern. (b) If the winning percentages of two (2) claiming Teams are the same, then the tie shall be determined, if possible, on the basis of the Regular Season Games between the two (2) Teams, during the Season or during the preceding Season, as the case may be. If still tied, a toss of a coin shall determine priority. For the purpose of determining standings, both Conferences of the Association shall be deemed merged and a consolidated standing shall control. 5.06. Players Acquired Through Waivers. A Member who has acquired the rights and title to the contract of a Player through the waiver procedure may not sell or trade such rights for a period of thirty (30) days after the acquisition thereof; provided, however, that if the rights to such Player were acquired between Seasons, the 30-day period described herein shall begin on the first day of the next succeeding Season. 5.07. Additional Waiver Rules. The Commissioner or the Board of Governors may from time to time adopt additional rules (supplementary to these By-Laws) with respect to the operation of the waiver procedures. Such rules shall not be inconsistent with these By-Laws and shall apply to but shall not be limited to the mechanics of notice, inadvertent omission of notification to a Member and rules of construction as to time.

On any date on which the NBA initiates a wire transfer pursuant to paragraph I(a), the NBA shall give a notice by facsimile to the Players Association and the Escrow Agent setting forth the amount transferred, the reference number for the wire transfer and the name of the Player involved in the Grievance. If the amount transferred is the first deposit by the NBA with respect to the applicable Player and Grievance, the notice shall be in the form of exhibit I(b)(i); if the amount transferred is an additional deposit by the NBA with respect to the applicable Player and Grievance, the notice shall be in the form of exhibit 1(b )(ii). On the business day immediately following its receipt of a notice pursuant to this paragraph I(b), the Escrow Agent shall deliver a copy of that notice to the NBA, the Players Association and the Team involved, acknowledging receipt of those funds and their deposit into an escrow account pursuant to this agreement (or, if applicable, a separate notice advising that those funds had not been received as of 12:00 p.m.(NYT) on such next business day). All amounts deposited by the NBA with the Escrow Agent under this agreement shall be held in an escrow account bearing the name of the NBA, the name of the Team involved, the name of the Player, the date of the initial deposit and the words “Grievance Escrow Account,” which account shall be separate from all other accounts created under this agreement. The Escrow Agent shall invest the amounts deposited with it pursuant to this agreement in the Escrow Agent’s interest bearing money market account. All interest earned on those amounts shall be held and disposed of by the Escrow Agent pursuant to this agreement. At least once each month during the term of this agreement, commencing with the month following the month in which the first escrow account is established, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the NBA and the Players Association a statement reflecting the investment activity with respect to each escrow account established under this agreement during the prior month. If the Escrow Agent receives a writing signed jointly by a person certifying that he is an NBA Officer and a person certifying that he is a Players Association Officer and giving the Escrow Agent directions with respect to all or part of the funds in a particular escrow account, the Escrow Agent shall comply promptly with such directions.
