\chaptermark{EXHIBITION GAMES, OFF-SEASON \ldots}

## Exhibition Games.

Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 of the Uniform Player Contract, players shall be required to participate in Exhibition games between an NBA Team and a non-member of the NBA at any location, within or outside the United States, subject to the following conditions:

(a) The NBA shall supervise the arrangements made with respect to tournaments or series conducted outside the United States and the accommodations provided to NBA players participating in such foreign tournaments or series.
(b) The NBA shall use its best efforts to establish an Exhibition game schedule pursuant to which excessive travel will be avoided and reasonable periods of time between games will be allotted.
(c) In any year in which it is played, the annual Basketball Hall of Fame Exhibition game shall be considered as one of the eight exhibition games prior to the Regular Season referred to in paragraph 2 of the Uniform Player Contract.

## Inter-Squad Scrimmage.

In addition to the Exhibition games provided for by paragraph 2 of the Uniform Player Contract, and during each of the playoff series conducted during the term of this Agreement, any Team that qualifies for the playoffs but is not required to participate in the first round thereof, may arrange and require its players to participate in one inter-squad game or scrimmage with another similarly situated Team, provided that such game or scrimmage is not open to members of the general public.

## Off-Season Basketball Events.

No player may play in any public off-season basketball game, summer league (e.g., Southern California Pro League or the Doral Arrowwood Summer League), or public exhibition or competition of basketball skills (e.g., a slam dunk contest or a "tour" organized by an NBA business partner) (each a "Basketball Event") unless such Basketball Event is approved in writing by the NBA. The NBA will consider an off-season Basketball Event for approval only if a request for such approval is submitted in writing to the NBA prior to the April 1 immediately preceding the off-season in which such Basketball Event is to be conducted, and only if the arrangements made with respect to any such off-season Basketball Event are confirmed in writing by the NBA and satisfy the following requirements:

    (vi) Participating players are not paid or compensated (in excess of per diem and actual expenses incurred in traveling to and participating in the game);
    (vii) The organizer guarantees that the game will produce at least \$100,000 for charity, and, if directed by the NBA and the Players Association, posts security for such amount in a form satisfactory to the NBA and the Players Association which grants the NBA and/or the Players Association the right to sue to recover such amount for the benefit of the charity;
    (viii) The game is played in the United States or Canada; and

    (v) Each league game is played in the United States or Canada.
(d) Notwithstanding any other terms of this Section 3, and without limiting the right of the NBA to approve all arrangements of a proposed Basketball Event, the NBA may, in its sole discretion, require, as a condition of its approval of a Basketball Event (other than a charitable game or summer league), that the Basketball Event organizer pay an appropriate fee to the NBA prior to the commencement of the Basketball Event.
(e) For purposes of this Section 3, any game or competition in which an NBA player participates on behalf of USA Basketball or any other national basketball federation will not be considered a Basketball Event; provided, however, that the NBA shall, after reasonable consultation with the Players Association, determine the requirements that shall govern player participation in any such game or competition.
